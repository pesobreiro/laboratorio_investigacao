abstract = {Biological invasions are one of the most relevant factors of biodiversity loss, especially after fire disturbances. Wildfires can accelerate invasions of fire-prone species, like Pinus radiata, and dramatically alter ecosystems. However, how to assess the main impacts of this invasion process on the composition, structure, and functionality of ecosystems, including the post-fire revegetation processes, has not been fully resolved. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of P. radiata invasion on fire-damaged forest ecosystems using combined remote sensing and in situ data, focusing particularly on changes in biodiversity, ecosystem structure, and functionality. The recovery of forest leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were monitored using Sentinel-2 time series products. Then the pre- and post-fire native community composition and the relationships of invasion and biodiversity with biotic and abiotic components were characterized using structural equation modeling (SEM). The postfire P. radiata density was mapped to quantify invasion intensity in three burned native forest fragments using generalized additive modeling (GAM) regressions based on UAS multispectral data. Biophysical metrics indicate that all forest fragments impacted by high, medium-high, and medium-low severity fires achieved a partial recovery of their canopy. The SEM model showed that microtopographic features and vegetation height explain native species diversity under pre-fire conditions due to their close relationship with favorable microclimatic conditions for species establishment. Vegetation height determined the abundance of P. radiata in post-fire conditions, and it negatively impacted diversity by promoting the homogenization of vegetation cover and altering diversity patterns. The general composition and abundance metrics also showed a substantial modification associated with the heavy (significant) invasion of P. radiata species. Predictive mapping of P. radiata density showed high accuracies (R2 =0.73 and explained deviation of 80%). The maps depicted an intense concentration of the invasive tree with a mean density of 76,217 individuals per ha−1 and high invasion spots with more than 176,000 individuals per ha−1. The quantification of invasion and mapping is a fundamental input for prioritizing areas and resources for a large-scale restoration program, and is a priority to avoid the loss of these highly threatened forest ecosystems.}

abstract = {Reliable fire severity mapping is a vital resource for fire scientists and land management agencies globally. Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (∆FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (∆NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in ∆FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using ∆FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when ∆FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using ∆NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy (>95%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy (>74%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the ∆NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6%–21%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to ~55%. ∆NBR, ∆NDWI and ∆NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.}

In this paper, a user centric approach is proposed to establish communications in disaster affected and communication outage areas. The proposed scheme forms ad hoc clusters to facilitate emergency communications and connect end-users/ User Equipment (UE) to the core network. A novel cluster formation with single and multi-hop communication framework is proposed. The overall throughput in the formed clusters is maximized using convex optimization. In addition, an intelligent system is designed to label different clusters and their localities into affected and non-affected areas. As a proof of concept, the labeling is achieved on flooding dataset where region specific social media information is used in proposed machine learning techniques to classify the disaster-prone areas as flooded or unflooded. The suitable results of the proposed machine learning schemes suggest its use along with proposed clustering techniques to revive communications in disaster affected areas and to classify the impact of disaster for different locations in disaster-prone areas.}

The rate of spread (ROS) of fire, measured using UAV cameras (thermal and visible), was evaluated at 0.45 m/s. The experiment was numerically reproduced using a completely physical 2D model, namely FireStar2D, and the comparison with the experimental measurements mainly concerned the fire ROS and the heat fluxes received by three distant targets placed at the end of the plot. The results analysis shows that the considered fire has a wind-driven regime of propagation with a fire intensity higher than 7 MW/m. The numerical results are in fairly good agreement with the experimental measurements, within 11% difference for the ROS and 5% for the heat fluxes, validating consequently the relevance of the numerical approach to tackle such high-intensity wildfires. Despite the unfavorable wind and humidity conditions for fire propagation (U = 1.67 m/s and RH = 82%), this experiment confirms that such fire can exhibit a dangerous behavior due to the steep slope of the terrain.}

These woodlands are part of one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and, despite subsisting on just 200–400 mm of rainfall a year, can store considerable amounts of carbon. However, they face growing pressure from a combination of climate change and increasingly frequent and large wildfires, which have burned over a third of these slow-growing, fire-sensitive woodlands in last 50 years alone. To develop conservation strategies that bolster the long-term resilience of this unique ecosystem, we urgently need to understand how much old-growth woodland habitat remains intact and where it is distributed across this vast region. To tackle this challenge, we brought together data from an extensive network of field plots distributed across the region and combined this with information on vegetation 3D structure derived from drone, airborne and spaceborne LiDAR. Using this unique dataset, we developed a novel modelling framework to generate the first high-resolution maps of woodland tree size and age structure across the entire region. We found that 41.2% of the woodland habitat is covered by old-growth stands, equivalent to an area of approximately 39,187 km2. Only 10% of these old-growth woodlands fall within current protected areas managed by the state government. Instead, most remaining old-growth woodlands are found either within the Ngadju Indigenous Protected Area (26.9%) or outside of formal protected areas on leaseholds and privately owned lands (57.2%). Our maps of woodland size and age structure will help guide the targeted management and conservation of the Great Western Woodlands. Moreover, by developing a robust pipeline for integrating LiDAR data from multiple platforms, our study paves the way for mapping the 3D structure and carbon storage of open and heterogeneous woodland ecosystems from space.}

Unlike traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring, a usually costly and time-consuming enterprise, satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer a technically feasible and sustainable in time solution. Here, we devise a cost-effective and upgradeable spatiotemporal framework for monitoring the species-specific habitat availability changes across scales by trend analysis of habitat suitability index (HSI) derived from ecological niche models (ENMs; Maxent) and using time series of SRS data (MODIS). The SRS-ENM framework was applied for a large suite of native species (911), from major taxonomic groups (flora (vascular plants), amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), and listed in the IUCN Red List at regional (Iberian Peninsula) and continental (Europe) scales. The HSI-trend analyses predict cumulative reductions in habitat suitability for Threatened and Non-Threatened species across scales for the period 2002–2016. Specifically, 19% and 66% of the total grid cells for both species' groups showed negative trends at both regional and continental scales, respectively. Results were similar when considering all IUCN threat categories. All taxa groups showed a decrease in habitat suitability, but amphibians and reptiles groups hosted the largest number of negative HSI-trends grid cells. Considering all groups together, 12% and 34% of both study areas have strong reductions in habitat quality. We conclude that our framework detects increases and decreases in species' habitat suitability regardless of the spatial scale, extent, and pixel size. Species' range predictions across space and time based on SRS time series represent a promising Earth observation tool to support traditional risk assessment protocols and anticipate the decision-making process, while serving as a cross-scale biodiversity monitoring system.}

Although a variety of remote sensing approaches have been developed, more research is still needed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of fire severity mapping. This study proposes a unitemporal simulation approach based on the generation of synthetic spectral databases from linear spectral mixing. To fully exploit the potential of these training databases, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to build a classifier and regression model. The predictive models parameterized with the synthetic datasets were applied in a case study, the Sierra de Luna wildfire in Spain. Single date Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery of the immediate post-fire environment were used to develop the validation spectral datasets and a Pléiades orthoimage, providing the ground truth data. The four defined severity categories – unburned (UB), partial canopy unburned (PCU), canopy scorched (CS), and canopy consumed (CC) – demonstrated high accuracy in the bootstrapped (about 95%) and real validation sets (about 90%), with a slightly better performance observed when the Sentinel-2A dataset was used. Abundance of four ground covers (green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and ash) was also quantified with moderate (~45% for NPV) or high accuracy (higher than 75% for the remaining covers). No specific pattern in the comparison of sensors was observed. Variable importance analysis highlighted the complementary behavior of the spectral bands, although the contrast between the near and shortwave infrared regions stood out above the rest. Comparison of procedures reinforced the usefulness of the approach, as RF image-derived models and the multiple endmember spectral unmixing technique (MESMA) showed lower accuracy. The capabilities for detailed mapping are reflected in the development of different types of cartography (classification maps and fraction cover maps). The approach holds great potential for fire severity assessment, and future research needs to extend the predictive modeling to other burned areas – also in different ecosystems – and analyze its competence and the possible adaptations needed.}

abstract = {Forest fires are known for their high level of randomness and unpredictability, which often lead to significant ecological damage and human life loss. Existing forest fire detection technologies are not capable of detecting small-scale flames or smoke in real time, thus failing to meet the demands of real-time detection of forest fires using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient and lightweight forest fire detection method that utilizes synthetic images and UAVs to achieve real-time and high-precision detection of forest fires against complex backgrounds. Firstly, we propose the Dilation Repconv Cross Stage Partial Network (DRCSPNet), which enhances the detection capabilities for multiscale flames and smoke using multi-branch parallel joint dilation convolution and batch normalization, while effectively extracting features from different stages of forest fires. Secondly, to mitigate challenges associated with extreme lighting in forest scenes and large contrast variation in fire images, we propose a Global Mixed-Attention (GMA) model across feature pyramids to enhance information lost in high-dimensional feature maps and increase the robustness of the model through a multiscale fusion strategy. Finally, we present the Lite-Path Aggregation Network (Lite-PAN) with varying scales to improve effective feature flow for multilevel forest fires, addressing challenges that arise from various climatic conditions. Furthermore, we employ Unreal Engine 5 to generate forest fire datasets in four scenarios to address the issue of relatively limited aerial forest fire datasets. According to the results of the experiment, our proposed method achieves 58.39% mAP(mean Average Precision) with 5.703 GFLOPs (Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second) while yielding a frame rate of 33.5 Frames Per Second (FPS) on NVIDIA Jetson NX. Extensive experiment results demonstrate our method has the advantage of being in real time, extremely accurate, and easily implementable compared to state-of-the-art techniques.}

abstract = {Rangelands cover 70% of the world's land surface, and provide critical ecosystem services of primary production, soil carbon storage, and nutrient cycling. These ecosystem services are governed by very fine-scale spatial patterning of soil carbon, nutrients, and plant species at the centimeter-to-meter scales, a phenomenon known as “islands of fertility”. Such fine-scale dynamics are challenging to detect with most satellite and manned airborne platforms. Remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an alternative option for detecting fine-scale soil nutrient and plant species changes in rangelands tn0020 smaller extents. We demonstrate that a model incorporating the fusion of UAV multispectral and structure-from-motion photogrammetry classifies plant functional types and bare soil cover with an overall accuracy of 95% in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment and disturbed by fire. We further demonstrate that employing UAV hyperspectral and LiDAR fusion greatly improves upon these results by classifying 9 different plant species and soil fertility microsite types (SFMT) with an overall accuracy of 87%. Among them, creosote bush and black grama, the most important native species in the rangeland, have the highest producer's accuracies at 98% and 94%, respectively. The integration of UAV LiDAR-derived plant height differences was critical in these improvements. Finally, we use synthesis of the UAV datasets with ground-based LiDAR surveys and lab characterization of soils to estimate that the burned rangeland potentially lost 1474 kg/ha of C and 113 kg/ha of N owing to soil erosion processes during the first year after a prescribed fire. However, during the second-year post-fire, grass and plant-interspace SFMT functioned as net sinks for sediment and nutrients and gained approximately 175 kg/ha C and 14 kg/ha N, combined. These results provide important site-specific insight that is relevant to the 423 Mha of grasslands and shrublands that are burned globally each year. While fire, and specifically post-fire erosion, can degrade some rangelands, post-fire plant-soil-nutrient dynamics might provide a competitive advantage to grasses in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment. These novel UAV and ground-based LiDAR remote sensing approaches thus provide important details towards more accurate accounting of the carbon and nutrients in the soil surface of rangelands.}

Vegetation indices such as the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) have become a standard tool to assess burn or fire severity across larger areas and are being used operationally. Despite the frequent application of dNBR-like vegetation indices, it is not yet fully understood which variables exactly drive the variability in dNBR observed by multispectral satellites. One reason for this is the lack of high quality prefire information about vegetation structure and composition. Consequently, the influence of prefire vegetation composition and other potentially influential variables such as cast shadows has hardly been examined. Here, we use very high resolution Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) orthoimages collected briefly before and after the large wildfires in Central Chile in the fire season 2016/2017 to derive variables related to the pre- and postfire landscape composition and structure. The variables are used as predictors in Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to explain the spatial variability in dNBR and RdNBR pixel values as observed by Sentinel-2. Our models explain more than 80% and 75% of the variability in dNBR and RdNBR values, respectively, using a sparse set of five predictors. The results suggest that in our study area the largest fraction of variability in Sentinel-2 based dNBR and RdNBR values can be explained by variables related to the fraction of consumed canopy cover while the vegetation composition before the fire does not have a large influence on dNBR and RdNBR. Our results further suggest that cast-shadows of snags and standing dead trees with remaining crown structure have a notable influence on the dNBR signal which may have been underestimated so far. We conclude that spatially continuous, very high spatial resolution data from UAS can be a valuable data source for an improved understanding of the exact meaning of common vegetation index products, operationally used for monitoring the environment.}

abstract = {Realizing a visual flying environment in various scenarios is an instrumental key to establishing visual hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation for flying UAVs. To simulate a desired UAV flying mission for a specific building landing in arbitrary geodetic coordinates, a new approach is presented. The approach fulfills the UAV landing HIL via three key elements: Building, Training, and Servoing. Building a flying dynamic scene which is not limited to a certain scenario, but can be utilized for generating different aerial remote sensing scenes according to desired geodetic coordinates (location-free), flying mission, perspective angles, and approaching velocities. The dynamic scene is constructed via RHINO graphics software based on georeferenced images taken at different altitudes. Training a deep detection framework on the extracted dataset from each constructed scene to localize a specific building as a landing platform. Servoing a pan–tilt camera on an embedded system by a pure image-based visual servoing (IBVS) method to coincide the detected building center with the acquired frame center during the flight. Tiny-YOLOv4 is picked as a light detector that runs on Nvidia nano with a servo kit and achieves a satisfactory result even with two wind disturbances models in a real-time condition. Thus, verifying a successful UAV landing on a specific building approach is accomplished.}

Employing a suite of machine learning algorithms and methodologies, including the novel combination of nested cross-validation with SMOTE and class reduction, the study identifies key building attributes that significantly impact vulnerability. Our proposed methodology achieves over 90% accuracy in predicting damage levels on unseen datasets across multiple algorithms. Contrary to expectations, the presence of soft-stories and structural modifications, while significant in other contexts, did not exhibit a significant association with damage severity, suggesting unique responses to blast loads compared to other types of loading. The developed methodology can also be applied to other disaster types to better understand the attributes affecting the behavior of URM buildings in different contexts. The results of this research can help architects, engineers, and policymakers develop targeted retrofitting strategies, refine building regulations, and create effective zoning protocols to enhance the resilience of historic urban environments against blast hazards.}

Addressing intertwined crises of climate change and biodiversity loss is a pressing global challenge, with trees playing pivotal roles in promoting carbon sequestration and habitat diversity. However, there is a distinct knowledge gap concerning the global drivers shaping tree cover and its heterogeneity, particularly the roles and relative importance of large herbivores and fire compared to climatic and topo-edaphic conditions. Here, we deploy satellite observations of strictly protected areas worldwide to reveal that in regions where vegetation may be in disequilibrium with climate, high biomass of large herbivores, especially browsers, is inversely related to tree cover but positively associated with its spatial heterogeneity. Conversely, fire reduces both tree cover and heterogeneity. These results suggest that top-down megafauna effects on landscape-scale vegetation openness and heterogeneity manifest worldwide. Our finding supports the need to consider megafauna, particularly large herbivores, in ecosystem effects on climate change mitigation and conservation and restoration efforts through trophic rewilding.}

First responders’ life threats when accessing the attacked zone are more severe in comparison to other disasters and the accuracy of basic information such as the number of terrorists, the number of trapped people, their locations and identity, etc., is vital to the reduction of the response time. Recent technologies for PSNs are designed to manage natural disaster scenarios; these are not best suited for situations like terrorist attacks because a proper communication infrastructure is required for operating most of the classical PSNs. This serious concern makes it highly desirable to develop reliable and adaptive pervasive public safety communication technologies to counter such a kind of emergency situation. Device-to-device (D2D) communication can be a vital paradigm to design PSNs that are fit for dealing with terrorist attacks thanks to long-term evolution (LTE)-sidelink, which could allow the devices that people carry with themselves in the attacked zone to communicate directly. To our best knowledge, this is the first survey paper on public safety communication in the context of terrorist attacks. We discuss PSN scenarios, architectures, 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards, and recent or ongoing related projects. We briefly describe a system architecture for disseminating the critical information, and we provide an extensive literature review of the technologies that could have a significant impact in public safety scenarios especially in terrorist attacks, such as beamforming and localization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), LTE sidelink for both centralized (base-station assisted) and decentralized (without base-station) architectures, multi-hop D2D routing for PSN, and jamming and anti-jamming in mobile networks. Furthermore, we also cover the channel models available in the literature to evaluate the performance of D2D communication in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the open challenges when applying these technologies for PSN.}

Despite a number of simplifying assumptions, the model is comprehensive enough to capture the major phenomena that govern the behaviour of a real fire — namely the pyrolysation of wood; the combustion of a mono-phase medium composed of premixed gas of fuel and air; and the heat transferred by conduction, convection, radiation, mass diffusion and transport due to atmospheric wind. The model consists of a system of coupled partial differential equations, one ensuring the balance of enthalpy, and a set of equations representing the mass formation of each chemical species involved in the combustion. Dimensionality reduction is sought by modelling these three-dimensional phenomena in a two-dimensional space, which has been achieved by means of heat-sources and heat-sinks to account for the third dimension in the energy balance equation. Once calibrated with a widely used non-physics-based commercial wildfire simulator, the proposed Fire Propagation Model for Fast simulations (FireProM-F) is tested, returning similar predictions in terms of the size and shape of the burnt area although similarity deteriorates for windy conditions. FireProM-F has the added benefit of being both physics-based and computationally inexpensive so that its interaction with fire suppressants may also be modelled in the future and simulated in real time.}

The main objective of this study is to minimize the total number of drones required to monitor an environment while providing the maximum coverage, which in turn leads to significant reduction in cost. Our simulation results show that by increasing the battery capacity of the drones, the drones’ visibility range would also increase and thus, the number of drones would be reduced. Moreover, when the targets are sparsely distributed across a large number of different regions, a further increase to the targets does not require an increase in the number of drones needed to monitor them.}

This is a critical area of research, as the proliferation of aerial and networked technologies has made their use in disaster management and response more common. Although concerns have been raised about the potential use of aerial and networked technologies in the surveillance and spatial discipline of populations by commercial and government actors, few have considered the implications for disaster management. In response, this article turns to geographical literature on necropower, verticality, and planetary spatialities to analyse technological innovations in responses to desert locust upsurges in Kenya. Drawing from qualitative research carried out between February 2020 and January 2021, we explain how desert locust control operations have shifted from horizontal to vertical to networked and planetary in nature through experimentation with new technologies over the past century. We argue that aerial and networked technologies have led to a volumetric shift in desert locust management and response, giving remote and increasingly automated actors who operate ‘above’ greater power over the life and death of populations ‘below’. In making this argument, we adopt a more-than-human perspective to account for how nonhuman entities and lifeforms shape and are subjected to necropolitical disaster management and responses. We conclude by reflecting on what this analytical approach has to offer the study of vertical and volumetric geographies.}

To our knowledge, this is the first UAS-based emission sampling for a fire of this magnitude, including both slash pile and crown fires resulting in wildfire-like conditions. The burns consisted of drip torch ignitions as well as ground-mobile and aerial helicopter ignitions of large stands comprising over 1000 ha, allowing for comparison of same-species emission factors burned under different conditions. The use of a UAS for emission sampling minimizes risk to personnel and equipment, allowing flexibility in sampling location and ensuring capture of representative, fresh smoke constituents. PM2.5 emission factors varied 5-fold and, like most pollutants, varied inversely with combustion efficiency resulting in lower emission factors from the slash piles than the crown fires.}

However, without considering the prior knowledge, e.g., equal attention on both classes of the fire and non-fire samples, fire miss-detected phenomena frequently appeared in the current methods. In this work, considering model’s interpretability and the limited data for model-training, we propose a novel pixel-precision method, termed as PreVM (Preferred Vector Machine). To guarantee high fire detection rate under precise control, a new L0 norm constraint is introduced to the fire class. Computationally, instead of the traditional L1 re-weighted techniques in L0 norm approximation, this L0 constraint can be converted into linear inequality and incorporated into the process of parameter selection. To further speed up model-training and reduce error warning rate, we also present a kernel-based L1 norm PreVM (L1-PreVM). Theoretically, we firstly prove the existence of dual representation for the general Lp (p≥1) norm regularization problems in RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space). Then, we provide a mathematical evidence for L1 norm kernelization to conquer the case when feature samples do not appear in pairs. The work also includes an extensive experimentation on the real forest fire images and videos. Compared with the-state-of-art methods, the results show that our PreVM is capable of simultaneously achieving higher fire detection rates and lower error warning rates, and L1-PreVM is also superior in real-time detection.}

This is usually accomplished through ground surveys, which can be costly and impractical depending on extent and accessibility, or conducted at too broad a spatial scale. In this study, we propose a methodology for mapping regenerating vegetation composition at 2 × 2 m2 spatial resolution, using very high spatial resolution (<1 m) remote sensing imagery obtained from remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) in conjunction with digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) techniques for reconstructing vegetation structure. We applied logistic regression on multispectral orthomosaics, clusters of vegetation structure, and local illumination estimates to develop presence-absence models for eight key plant groups at various taxonomic levels as well as six plant functional types (conifer tree seedlings, grasses, tall- and low-growing forbs, shrubs, and mosses). Our results show higher accuracies for plant functional types (mean F-score = 0.67) compared to lower taxonomic levels (0.57). Notably, shrubs (F-score = 0.79), low-growing forbs (0.70), and mosses (0.69) exhibited the highest accuracies, while grasses (0.46), the aster family (Asteraceae spp; 0.48), and spruce seedlings (Picea spp; 0.54) demonstrated lower accuracies. Vegetation structure variables were identified as the most influential in the models, with mean NIRv ranking highest among spectral variables. High average ranks of spectral variation metrics (e.g., standard deviation of NIRv) implied the influence of environmental determinants such as plant co-occurrences and micro-habitat conditions, which drive spectral variation. Discrete composition maps were produced for three restoration sites and analogous wildfire-disturbed sites. Plant compositions found at one site pair exhibited similarity (Bray-Curtis = 0.28), however, certain key plant groups covered larger extents of the restoration site than anticipated. Willows (Salix spp; 25.4% vs. 9.3%), which are typically planted for soil stabilization and obstruction, and clovers (Trifolium spp; 11.1% vs. 3.6%), which represent non-native agronomic vegetation, were prominent. The developed methodology facilitates the generation of detailed plant composition maps, aiding evaluations of vegetation patterns that are difficult to discern visually or through conventional field sampling. This approach can effectively help assess restoration goals and guide adaptive management strategies, especially when incorporating the expertise of restoration ecologists in understanding how different vegetation types affect habitat quality.}

Existing fire detection models face limitations in dataset availability, multi-scale feature extraction, and locating obscured or small flames and smoke.

Additionally, we propose the Ghost Convolution Swin Transformer (GCST) module to extract multi-scale flame and smoke features from different receptive fields by integrating parallel Ghost convolution and Swin Transformer. Subsequently, we design a lightweight reparameterized rotation attention module, which captures interactions across channel and spatial dimensions to suppress background noise and focus on obscured flames and smoke. Finally, we introduce a loss function, called Efficient Auxiliary Geometric Intersection over Union (EAGIoU), which employs an auxiliary bounding box to accelerate the model's convergence while integrating the geometrical principles of the predicted and real bounding boxes to accurately locate small flames and smoke. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 75.2 % mAP@0.5 and 42 % mAP@0.5:0.95 with a frame rate of 239 frames per second, indicating a significant improvement in accuracy and real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

This study is a review of methods based on geospatial information system (GIS) for modelling forest fires and their potential Natechs that have been implemented all over the world. The present study conducts a systematic literature review of the methods used for forest fire susceptibility, hazard, and risk assessment, while dividing them into four general categories: (a) statistical and data-driven models; (b) machine learning models; (c) multi-criteria decision-making models, and (d) ensemble models. In addition, some forest fire detection techniques using satellite imagery are reviewed. A comparison is also conducted to highlight the research gaps and required future research. The results of the present research assist decision makers to select the most appropriate techniques according to specific forest conditions.

Our methodology is composed of three stages: problem definition, system AI solution, and AI technical solution to design the AI technology and requirements that organizations need at a system level.

We assessed whether wildfires effectively mitigate the footprint of seismic lines by promoting forest recovery. We evaluated the forest structure of legacy seismic lines burned in 2001 and 2002 by comparing them against adjacent unburned control plots, using metrics derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data collected between 2007 and 2009. ALS metrics identified persistent differences in vegetation height and structure between seismic lines and adjacent forest controls, 7–9 years post-fire. Median canopy height was 2.90 m lower on upland seismic lines and 1.94 m lower on lowland seismic lines than on adjacent controls, corresponding to a 21% and 25% height reduction, respectively. Field surveys revealed greater graminoid and nonvascular plant cover, and lower tall-tree cover and dead vegetative matter, on seismic lines, in comparison with controls. Our results show that tree recovery remains significantly delayed on most upland and lowland burned seismic lines in our study area, and that additional management efforts or longer timescales may be required to restore these fragmented landscapes.
Les perturbations linéaires associées à l’exploration géologique (c.-à-d. les lignes sismiques) ont une vaste empreinte dans une grande partie de la forêt boréale de l’ouest du Canada. Cependant, on comprend mal de quelle façon les lignes sismiques interagissent par la suite avec les feux de forêt. Nous avons évalué si les feux de forêt atténuent effectivement l’empreinte des lignes sismiques en favorisant la récupération de la forêt. Nous avons évalué la structure de la forêt laissée en héritage par des lignes sismiques qui ont brûlé en 2001 et 2002 en les comparant à des parcelles témoins adjacentes non brûlées, à l’aide de mesures dérivées de données de balayage laser aéroporté (BLA) recueillies entre 2007 et 2009. Les mesures obtenues par BLA ont permis d’identifier des différences persistantes dans la hauteur et la structure de la végétation entre les lignes sismiques et les parcelles témoins adjacentes, 7 à 9 ans après le feu. La hauteur médiane du couvert forestier était 2,90 m plus courte dans les lignes sismiques des hautes terres et 1,94 m plus courte dans les lignes sismiques des basses terres que dans les témoins adjacents; ce qui correspond à une réduction de la hauteur de respectivement 21 et 25 %. Des relevés de terrain ont révélé la présence d’un couvert plus important de plantes non vasculaires et graminiformes, ainsi qu’un couvert moins important de grands arbres et de matière végétale morte dans les lignes sismiques, comparativement aux témoins. Nos résultats montrent que la récupération des arbres est significativement décalée dans les lignes sismiques brûlées sur les hautes et basses terres dans notre zone d’étude, et que des efforts additionnels d’aménagement ou des délais plus longs pourraient être nécessaires pour restaurer ces paysages fragmentés.

abstract = {Automatic detection of plant water status is a significant challenge in agriculture as it is a crucial regulator of growth, productivity, quality, and sustainability. As a result, accurate monitoring of the plant's water condition has become imperative. Internet of Things (IoT) solutions based on specific sensor data acquisition and intelligent processing can assist water users for precise irrigation by providing accurate, consistent, and fast results. This paper aims to present a hybrid deep learning approach based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for automatically identifying the water state of wheat. The intended scheme used IoT-based data transmission devices such as a digital camera, soil moisture, wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity. These environmental factors (EF) were recorded during the plant image capture. A total of 876 images of wheat plants were collected under different water deficit levels. A data augmentation approach was applied to expand the size of the training dataset to 5256 images. Various types of image color modes for example CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black), HSV (hue-saturation-value), RGB (red-greenblue), and grayscale were evaluated with our proposed methods. The experimental results indicated that the combined CNNRGB-LSTMEF-CNNEF deep network based on features from both RGB images, climatic conditions, and soil moisture performed better than features from individual RGB images. Its outputs of validation accuracy, classification precision, recall, F-measure, and intersection over union are 100% with a loss of 0.0012. The proposed system behavior is very encouraging to develop our methodology with other crops in the future. The designed framework can serve the agricultural community to detect the water stress of plants before the critical level of growth and make timely management decisions.}

abstract = {Visual object detection has emerged as a critical technology for Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) use due to advances in computer vision. New developments in fields like communication technology and the UAV needs to be able to act autonomously by gathering data and then making choices. These tendencies have brought us to cutting-edge levels of health care, transportation, energy, monitoring, and security for visual image detection and manufacturing endeavors. These include coordination in communication via IoT, sustainability of IoT network, and optimization challenges in path planning. Because of their limited battery life, these gadgets are limited in their range of communication. UAVs can be seen as terminal devices connected to a large network where a swarm of other UAVs is coordinating their motions, directing one another, and maintaining watch over locations outside its visual range. One of the essential components of UAV-based applications is the ability to recognize objects of interest in aerial photographs taken by UAVs. While aerial photos might be useful, object detection is challenging. As a result, capturing aerial photographs with UAVs is a unique challenge since the size of things in these images might vary greatly. The study proposal included specific information regarding the Detection of Visual Images by UAVs (DVI-UAV) using the IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Included in the study of AI is the concept of DSYolov3. The DSYolov3 model was presented to deal with these problems in the UAV industry. By fusing the channel-wise feature across multiple scales using a spatial pyramid pooling approach, the proposed study creates a novel module, Multi-scale Fusion of Channel Attention (MFCAM), for scale-variant object identification tasks. The method's effectiveness and efficiency have been thoroughly tested and evaluated experimentally. The suggested method would allow us to outperform most current detectors and guarantee that the models will be useable on UAVs. There will be a 95 % success rate in terms of visual image detection, a 94 % success rate in terms of computation cost, a 97 % success rate in terms of accuracy, and a 95 % success rate in terms of effectiveness.}

Using a comprehensive analytical framework that combines Geographical Detector (GeoDetector), Random Forest (RF) model, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Spearman's rank correlation, and k-means clustering, we analyzed data from national land surveys, climate records, and nighttime light observations. Our findings indicate a significant, though regionally varied, transformation in land use: arable land decreased by 1.67 %, driven by intense urbanization and policy shifts, particularly in rapidly urbanizing Jiangsu province where arable land diminished by 19.19 %. In contrast, construction land in the northern regions increased by 225.91 million hectares. Climatic influences are apparent, with rising temperatures positively correlating with arable land expansion in the Northeast and Northwest, and urban land in Jiangsu province increasing by 35.51 %. Variations in precipitation patterns were linked to changes in forested areas. This study highlights the dynamic and intricate interactions within the human-earth system, stressing the urgent need for sustainable land management and climate adaptation strategies that improve land use efficiency and resilience. Our research offers a solid foundation for informed policy-making in land management and climate adaptation, advocating a human-earth system science approach to address future environmental and societal challenges.}

But the increasing use of these technologies and data also provokes major ethical and social justice questions. In this scoping review, we examine the extent to and ways in which ethics and justice are discussed in relation to uses of remote sensing in conservation. Our literature search identifies only 31 peer-reviewed English language papers containing substantive discussion of justice and/or ethics and conservation remote sensing. Within these papers, emergent themes and tensions include the use of remote sensing technologies for surveillance (and the extent to which this is framed as positive or negative), the militarised associations of remote sensing technologies, the ways that remote sensing technologies can disrupt or harden power asymmetries, and whether the greatest ethical risks or benefits are seen as being for people or other species. Building on recommendations identified in this review, we reflect on how conservation can learn from work on data ethics in other fields, such as the ethics of artificial intelligence. We also discuss the mechanisms (such as formal laws, journal review procedures, and greater individual reflexivity) which could support the use of remote sensing technologies and data to advance socially just conservation. Finally, we highlight research priorities including the need for more comparative case study analyses, greater research efforts on the political economy and geopolitics of conservation remote sensing, and work which situates novel technologies within longer-standing debates about ethics and philosophies of biodiversity conservation.}

Accurate and quantitative monitoring of these emissions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of their impact on the Earth’s climate and for effectively enforcing emission regulations at a large scale. This work examines the feasibility of detecting and quantifying industrial smoke plumes using freely accessible geo-satellite imagery. The existing system has so many lagging factors such as limitations in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency and these factors hinder the effectiveness in supporting timely response to industrial fires. In this work, the utilization of grayscale images is done instead of traditional color images for smoke plume detection. The dataset was trained through a ResNet-50 model for classification and a U-Net model for segmentation. The dataset consists of images gathered by European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite constellation from a selection of industrial sites. The acquired images predominantly capture scenes of industrial locations, some of which exhibit active smoke plume emissions. The performance of the above-mentioned techniques and models is represented by their accuracy and IOU (Intersection-over-Union) metric. The images are first trained on the basic RGB images where their respective classification using the ResNet-50 model results in an accuracy of 94.4% and segmentation using the U-Net Model with an IOU metric of 0.5 and accuracy of 94% which leads to the detection of exact patches where the smoke plume has occurred. This work has trained the classification model on grayscale images achieving a good increase in accuracy of 96.4%.}

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely utilized for surveying various sediment disasters, and the high-resolution imaging they provide reveals detailed topographic characteristics. However, the availability of multitemporal UAV observations, which reveal geomorphological changes before and after the disaster, is still limited. In this research, we performed multitemporal UAV observations for geomorphological changes before and after extreme postfire heavy rain in the Ozaki Peninsula wildfire area in Japan. Significant geomorphological changes were observed associated with eight landslides and stream shifting, with a spatial resolution of 0.30 cm obtained by structure from motion (SfM) processing. To extract the surface changes based on multitemporal UAV observations, in addition to elevation displacement, vertex normal vectors were calculated for each mesh. We found that the elevation displacement showed comprehensive alterations in the entire area and that the changes in vertex normal vectors effectively captured the shape of these alterations. Deterioration, deposition, and scarping were shown for landslides, and the dynamics of erosion and deposition in the cross-section were for stream shifting. In addition, the detected geomorphological changes were compared with the predisaster topographic characteristics. Landslides occurred with a catchment area of 500 to 2,000 m2 and a slope inclination of 30 to 40°, and stream shifting occurred with a catchment area of 10,000 m2 or more and a slope inclination of less than 20°. In both regions affected by landslides and stream shifting, the logarithmic stream power index (logSPI), a natural logarithmic representation of the conventional stream power index (SPI), could describe the characteristics roughly. A logSPI value of 4 to 5 represented landslides, and 5 and greater represented stream shifting, with the probability of landslides and stream shifting occurring in areas with these values exceeding 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively. Therefore, the logSPI was utilized to roughly classify the terrain and geomorphological condition and the points among the unburnt, unlogged-burnt, and logged-burnt areas were compared. Even when the logSPI was similar, the damage was much more severe in the burnt areas. On slopes with a logSPI of approximately 4, there were signs of erosion in the logged-burnt area, and the increase in fallen trees was significant in the unlogged-burnt area, while there were no substantial changes in the unburnt area. In valleys with a logSPI of 8 or greater, sediment and woody debris were significantly deposited in the burnt areas following the postfire rain, while there were few changes in the unburnt area.}

In order to prevent power failures, timely and thorough powerline inspections are needed to detect possible anomalies in advance. In the past few years, the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted sensors (e.g. light detection and ranging/lidar, optical cameras, infrared cameras, and ultraviolet cameras) have provided rich data sources for comprehensive and accurate powerline inspections. A challenge that still hinders the use of UAVs in powerline inspection is that their operation is highly dependent on the pilot’s experience, which may pose risks to the safety of the powerline system and reduce inspection efficiency. An intelligent automatic inspection solution could overcome the limitations of current UAV-based inspection solutions. The main objective of this paper is to provide a contemporary look at the current state-of-the-art UAV-based inspections as well as to discuss a potential lidar-supported intelligent powerline inspection concept. Overall, standardized protocols for lidar-supported intelligent powerline inspections include four data analysis steps, i.e., point cloud classification, key point extraction, route generation, and fault detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we implemented a workflow using a dataset of 3536 powerline spans, showing that the inspection of a single powerline span could be completed in 10 min with only one or two technicians. This demonstrates that lidar-supported intelligent inspection can be used to inspect a powerline system with extremely high efficiency and low costs.}

Here, we applied an array of machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to estimate the relative importance of various factors in observed patterns of Eastern Siberian fires mapped with satellite data. More specifically, we tested linkages of “hot spot” ignitions with 42 variables representing landscape characteristics, climatic, and anthropogenic factors, such as human population density, locations of settlements and road networks. Analysis of data spanning seventeen years (2001–2017) showed that during low or moderately high fire seasons, models with full set of variables predict locations of fires with a very high probability (AUC = 95%). Sensitivity, or the ratio of correctly predicted fire pixels to the total number of pixels analyzed, declined to 30–40% during warm and dry years of increased fire activity, especially in models driven by anthropogenic variables only. This analysis demonstrates that if warming in Eastern Siberia continues, forest fires will become not only more frequent but also less predictable. We explain this by examining model performance as a function of either temperature or precipitation. This effect from climate makes it nearly impossible to segregate ignition points from locations, which were burnt several hours or even several days earlier. An increase in secondary burnt locations makes it difficult for machine learning algorithms to establish causality links with anthropogenic and other groups of variables.}

Poor and unscientific documentation of wildfire leads to error prone and quickly outdated event curation, making it difficult to create comprehensive overviews of wildfire events. Although several geospatial studies have recorded advances in wildfire data curation, many of these rely on structured spatial datasets which enjoy numerous advantages but can be prone to temporal or time-voids in data. Voids in data can be mitigated through interpolation techniques, but these are not without challenges for the modellers tasked with optimally filling the voids. On this backdrop, this paper therefore aims to test and extend strategies of wildfire reporting by investigating the strengths of fusing mainstream spatial data (including high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) footage) with unstructured Twitter (tweets) data in order to disrupt common practise and contribute to the global agenda. The novelty of this contribution lies in its unusual hybrid data approach used to statistically establishes long- and short-term pre-fire conditions tested on the African landscape. It proceeds to illustrate how the social media data can create fascinating and yet accurate visual timelines of the events that surprisingly compared strongly to the results from structured sources. Finally, the study detects the extent of damage from the wildfire using supervised classification, burn indices and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. A 95% positive detection rate was reported, and it affirmed the place of unstructured data in mainstream scientific approaches such as wildfire documentation. The work presented therefore contributes towards meeting African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2030) in curation, documentation and mitigation of sustainable community and environments.}

These efforts rely upon the accessibility of high spatial and temporal resolution data on biomass and canopy fuel parameters such as canopy base height (CBH), mean canopy height, canopy bulk density (CBD), canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI). Remote sensing using unoccupied aerial system Structure-from-Motion (UAS-SfM) presents a promising technology for this application due to its accessibility, relatively low cost, and possibility for high temporal cadence. However, to date, this method has not been studied in the complex mosaic of forest types found across California. In this study we examined the capacity of structural and multispectral information obtained from UAS-SfM, in conjunction with machine learning methods, to model aboveground biomass and forest canopy fuel structural parameters using an area-based approach across multiple sites representing a diversity of forest types in California. Based on correlations with field measurements, fuel parameters separated into vertical (biomass, CBH, and mean height) and horizontal (LAI, CBD, canopy cover) groups. UAS-SfM random forest models performed well for modelling the vertical structure canopy fuels parameters (R2 0.69–0.75). These models exhibited strong performance in comparison to ALS, as well as when transferred to a novel site. Vertical structure predictors were prominent in these models, and did not improve with the addition of spectral predictors. UAS-SfM random forest models of horizontal structure parameters mainly used raster-based spectral indices (primarily NDVI) and had relatively low performance (R2 0.49–0.59). In addition, these models underperformed ALS and had poor performance when applied to a novel site. When applied to a region with widespread UAS-SfM coverage, models from both groups successfully produced contiguous maps that could be used for modelling fire behavior or in management decision making and monitoring. These findings indicate that UAS-SfM, without the need for multispectral sensors, is well suited for mapping area-based vertical-structure canopy parameters across diverse landscapes supporting a wide range of forest types. In contrast, the identification of spectral mean variables for modelling horizontal structure canopy fuels suggests the potential of multi- or hyperspectral sensors or high-resolution satellite imagery for meeting management information needs.}

Modern edge-centric networks have become autonomous and decentralized to expand IoT applications and corresponding data fusion. When edge networks are uncertain, network entities execute tasks locally to increase network performance. Over the past decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have been integrated into edge networks to generate optimal decisions and intelligent edge networks. However, complex edge networks with ample state and action space create several challenges in making optimal decisions with the RL technique. To address such shortcomings, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is combined with edge networks to build an intelligent edge framework. Concerning the benefits of edge intelligence, this paper summarizes the importance of traditional and advanced DRL methodologies in edge networks. Besides, we discuss different types of DRL-enabled libraries and state-of-the-art edge models for processing real-time IoT applications. Then, we review other emerging issues in edge networks regarding data offloading, caching, dynamic network access, edge information fusion, and data privacy. Moreover, we incorporate various DRL-enabled IoT applications in edge networks such as healthcare applications, industrial applications, traffic management, etc. Finally, we shed light on future trends of intelligent edge computing regarding system performance, security, and network management.}

abstract = {Fires and burning are the chief causes of particulate matter (PM2.5), a key measurement of air quality in communities and cities worldwide. This work develops a live fire tracking platform to show active reported fires from over twenty cities in the U.S., as well as predict their smoke paths and impacts on the air quality of regions within their range. Specifically, our close to real-time tracking and predictions culminates in a digital twin to protect public health and inform the public of fire and air quality risk. This tool tracks fire incidents in real-time, utilizes the 3D building footprints of Austin to simulate smoke outputs, and predicts fire incident smoke falloffs within the complex city environment. Results from this study include a complete fire and smoke digital twin model for Austin. We work in cooperation with the City of Austin Fire Department to ensure the accuracy of our forecast and also show that air quality sensor density within our cities cannot validate urban fire presence. We additionally release code and methodology to replicate these results for any city in the world. This work paves the path for similar digital twin models to be developed and deployed to better protect the health and safety of citizens.

abstract = {Canopy cover (CC) is the proportion of a forest floor covered by the vertical projection of tree crowns. Recently, it has become common to utilize LiDAR (light detection and ranging) canopy metrics to estimate CC over large areas. However, these metrics are primarily related to canopy density rather than the specific definition of CC. Here, two processes that employed individual tree segmentation (ITS) and area-based procedures based on LiDAR data are presented to estimate CC across the Talladega Division of the Talladega National Forest (93,694 ha) at the plot, stand, and landscape levels. The two analytical procedures were assessed using the results of a plot/grid method as a reference dataset, which focused on CC estimates within 255 field measurement fixed-area sample plots. The accuracy of a third process, employing an imagery-based visual CC assessment, was also compared against the two procedures and the reference dataset. The LiDAR-based analytical procedures were able to provide estimates of CC with an RMSE of approximately 15 %, which is acceptable for landscape-level assessments. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that CC maps, when created using LiDAR data, may be suitable for various operational tasks such as assessing the impact of forest disturbances and helping to determine the habitat suitability for certain wildlife species.}

abstract = {Despite advances in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) efficiencies, multiple contaminants of concern, such as microplastics, pharmaceuticals, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) remain largely untreated near discharge points and can be highly concentrated before they are fully mixed within the receiving river. Environmental agencies enforce mixing zone permits for the temporary exceedance of water quality parameters beyond targeted control levels under the assumption that contaminants are well-mixed and diluted downstream of mixing lengths, which are typically quantified using empirical equations derived from one-dimensional transport models. Most of these equations were developed in the 1970s and have been assumed to be standard practice since then. However, their development and validation lacked the technological advances required to test them in the field and under changing flow conditions. While new monitoring techniques such as remote sensing and infrared imaging have been employed to visualize mixing lengths and test the validity of empirical equations, those methods cannot be easily repeated due to high costs or flight restrictions. We investigated the application of Lagrangian and Eulerian monitoring approaches to experimentally quantify mixing lengths downstream of a WWTP discharging into the Rio Grande near Albuquerque, New Mexico (USA). Our data spans river to WWTP discharges ranging between 2-22x, thus providing a unique dataset to test long-standing empirical equations in the field. Our results consistently show empirical equations could not describe our experimental mixing lengths. Specifically, while our experimental data revealed “bell-shaped” mixing lengths as a function of increasing river discharges, all empirical equations predicted monotonically increasing mixing lengths. Those mismatches between experimental and empirical mixing lengths are likely due to the existence of threshold processes defining mixing at different flow regimes, i.e., jet diffusion at low flows, the Coanda effect at intermediate flows, and turbulent mixing at higher flows, which are unaccounted for by the one-dimensional empirical formulas. Our results call for a review of the use of empirical mixing lengths in streams and rivers to avoid widespread exposures to emerging contaminants.}

In addition, other crucial factors like site control and the proximity of nearby Russian troops are also considered in developing this suitability model. Human analysts with military knowledge, understanding of standard operating procedure and the strategic importance of a developing battlefield were deployed to identify potential tactical firing locations. The proposed model was developed on Google Earth Engine for ease of distribution and deployment. Four case studies are demonstrated to illustrate the implemented model, interpreted in the context of ongoing conflicts and verified by geospatial intelligence crowdsourced and/or reported by the public and social media.

abstract = {Peat wildfires are the largest fires on Earth involving both flaming and smouldering combustion, with one leading to the other. A common ignition source of smouldering fires in tropical peatlands are intentional flaming fires used to clear surface vegetation. To capture the behaviour of these fires, it is necessary to consider the interaction between flaming vegetation and smouldering peat. However, doing so is infeasible with the state-of-the-art wildfire models, as they do not consider the transition from flaming to smouldering and are computationally too expensive at the field-scale hundreds of hectares. In this work, we overcome these limitations and model both flaming and smouldering at the field-scale using cellular automata: that is a discrete mathematical model that uses simple rules to capture complex behaviour while remaining computationally light. The model was calibrated against existing experiments in the literature and used to predict the effect of peat moisture content on the behaviour of peatland wildfires. The model shows how flaming creates smouldering hotspots and how these hotspots merge – flaming spreads rapidly, consuming surface vegetation, leaving behind hotspots of smouldering peat which consumes most of the peat. The model was then applied to study a real prescribed fire of 573 ha peatland in Borneo in 2015, observed by drone footage. The model captured the spread patterns of the fire and predicted that 2.9 ha of peatland burnt after 3 months with 70% peat moisture content (dry-based). This ioutcome could have been reduced to 0.02 ha if the peat moisture content had been above 100%. This work improves the fundamental understanding of how peat wildfires spread at the field scale which has received little attention until now.}

abstract = {Forest fires are a huge ecological hazard, and smoke is an early characteristic of forest fires. Smoke is present only in a tiny region in images that are captured in the early stages of smoke occurrence or when the smoke is far from the camera. Furthermore, smoke dispersal is uneven, and the background environment is complicated and changing, thereby leading to inconspicuous pixel-based features that complicate smoke detection. In this paper, we propose a detection method called multioriented detection based on a value conversion-attention mechanism module and Mixed-NMS (MVMNet). First, a multioriented detection method is proposed. In contrast to traditional detection techniques, this method includes an angle parameter in the data loading process and calculates the target’s rotation angle using the classification prediction method, which has reference significance for determining the direction of the fire source. Then, to address the issue of inconsistent image input size while preserving more feature information, Softpool-spatial pyramid pooling (Soft-SPP) is proposed. Next, we construct a value conversion-attention mechanism module (VAM) based on the joint weighting strategy in the horizontal and vertical directions, which can specifically extract the colour and texture of the smoke. Ultimately, the DIoU-NMS and Skew-NMS hybrid nonmaximum suppression methods are employed to address the issues of smoke false detection and missed detection. Experiments are conducted using the homemade forest fire multioriented detection dataset, and the results demonstrate that compared to the traditional detection method, our model’s mAP reaches 78.92%, mAP 50 reaches 88.05%, and FPS reaches 122.}

Although three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models have been successfully applied to wildfires, the computational time required makes them currently impractical for operational usage. In this study, we develop a two-dimensional propagation model coupled to a ‘pyrogenic’ potential flow formulation representing the inflow of air generated by the fire. This model can accurately replicate features of fires previously unable to be simulated using current two-dimensional models, including development of a fire line into a parabolic shape, attraction between nearby fires and the observed closing behaviour of ‘V’ shaped fires. The model is compared to experimental results with good agreement. The pyrogenic potential model is orders of magnitude faster than a full CFD model, and could be used for improved operational wildfire prediction.}

Online thermal response prediction is a key step to intelligent thermal protection systems. In this paper, the concept of Dynamic Data-Driven Application System between simulations and experiments is employed to achieve online thermal response prediction. In this framework, measured temperature data are injected into an online heat transfer model, and the real-time temperature at the bottom of the thermal protection system is calculated. A demonstration test system is built and experiments were carried out to validate the method. The effects of dynamic data and the number of sensors on the temperature prediction accuracy are analyzed. Dynamic data-driven temperature predictions under transient heat load are also carried out. The dynamic data-driven model can reduce the temperature prediction error from 25.9% to less than 10% based on the experimental results, and increasing the number of sensors can also improve the prediction accuracy. The model also has good adaptability under accidental overload and cyclic load.

LAI estimation through remote sensing data has mostly been investigated using visible and near-infrared (0.4–1.3 μm, VNIR) and Shortwave Infrared (1.4–3 μm, SWIR) data. However, Thermal Infrared (3–14 μm, TIR) data for LAI retrieval has rarely been explored. This study aims to predict LAI by integrating VNIR and TIR data from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in a mixed temperate forest, the Haagse Bos, Enschede, the Netherlands. The VNIR and TIR images were acquired in September 2020, in conjunction with fieldwork to collect LAI in situ data for 30 plots. TIR images were acquired at two heights (i.e., 85 m and 120 m above ground) to investigate the effect of flight height on the LAI prediction accuracy by means of UAS data. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) were computed and extracted from the collected images. LAI was estimated using seven vegetation indices and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). LAI prediction accuracy using VNIR reflectance spectra was compared to the accuracy achieved by integrating VNIR data with LST or LSE applying vegetation indices as well as PLSR. Among the applied vegetation indices, the Reduced Simple Ratio (RSR) gained the highest prediction accuracy using VNIR data (R2 = 0.5815, RMSE = 0.6972); the prediction accuracy was not improved when LST was integrated with VNIR data but increased when LSE was included (RSR: R2 = 0.7458, RMSE = 0.5081). However, when LST from 85 m altitude and VNIR data was applied as an input using PLSR (R2 = 0.5565, RMSECV = 0.7998), the LAI prediction accuracy was slightly increased compared to when only VNIR data was used (R2 = 0.4452, RMSECV = 0.8668). Integrating VNIR data with LSE significantly improved the LAI retrieval accuracy (R2 = 0.7907, RMSECV = 0.8351). These findings corroborate prior research indicating that combining LSE with VNIR data can increase the prediction accuracy of LAI. However, LST was found to be ineffective for this purpose. The relationship between LAI and LSE should be the subject of more investigation through various approachesto bridge the existingscientific gap.}

Vegetation composition and structure are recognised indicators for carbon sequestration and storage potential in these ecosystems, but decadal dynamics and roles of autogenic succession, climate, and land-use herein remain poorly understood. We assessed vegetation changes in the least disturbed centre of twelve Irish peatland reserves sampled across a gradient in temperature and precipitation between 1978(1983)–2021, combining re-classified traditional high-resolution vegetation maps with recent very high-resolution drone imagery. Specifically, we tested whether microform proportions of open water, wet hollow, moist lawn, and dry hummock had changed and explored to what extent changes were related to climate and land-use drivers. Results revealed that the studied peatlands underwent an overall unidirectional surface drying trend, with dry hummocks expanding at the expense of open water and wet hollow, while moist lawns remained approximately equal in proportions. The degree of change varied between the studied peatlands, with western blanket bogs and unrestored raised bogs experiencing more surface drying than mountain blanket bogs and raised bogs under hydrological restoration. While our results indicated climate and/or land-use as drivers of surface drying, our sample size was too small to make definitive conclusions about their exact role. The overall change from wet to dry surface conditions between 1978 and 2021 occurred at a much faster rate than hitherto reported for these slow-changing ecosystems. This raises concern for the future resilience of peatlands to changes in climate and land-use, as well as their potential impact on the peatland carbon balance.}

Therefore, exploration, routine inspections, and surveillance tasks can benefit from using autonomous mobile robots to improve safety by reducing the presence of humans in those scenarios. However, despite advances in the field, there are still challenges to overcome for confined and subterranean robot operation. Real word robotic exploration requires robust and reliable map generation, precise localization, safe navigation, and efficient path planning. These requirements make exploration in complex 3D environments with rugged terrain difficult. The challenge is increased when considering multi-robot teams, as there is no guarantee of a functional network infrastructure. Despite consistent increasing interest in the area, there is a lack of research summarizing the results and best practices for exploring such environments. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a review and discuss state-of-the-art robotic exploration techniques, including single and cooperative approaches with homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, with a focus on complex subterranean and confined 3D scenarios.

Satellite-derived vegetation indices indicate widespread greening of the surface, often associated with regional evidence of shrub expansion obtained from long-term ecological monitoring and repeated orthophotos. However, explicitly quantifying shrub expansion across large scales using satellite observations requires characterising the fine-scale mosaic of Arctic vegetation types beyond index-based approaches. Although previous studies have illustrated the potential of estimating fractional cover of various Plant Functional Types (PFTs) from satellite imagery, limited availability of reference data across space and time has constrained deriving fraction cover time series capable of detecting shrub expansion. We applied regression-based unmixing using synthetic training data to build multitemporal machine learning models in order to estimate fractional cover of shrubs and other surface components in the Mackenzie Delta Region for six time intervals between 1984 and 2020. We trained Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal-metrics and synthetic training data generated from pure class spectra obtained directly from the imagery. Independent validation using very-high-resolution imagery suggested that KRR outperforms RFR, estimating shrub cover with a MAE of 10.6% and remaining surface components with MAEs between 3.0 and 11.2%. Canopy-forming shrubs were well modelled across all cover densities, coniferous tree cover tended to be overestimated and differentiating between herbaceous and lichen cover was challenging. Shrub cover expanded by on average + 2.2% per decade for the entire study area and + 4.2% per decade within the low Arctic tundra, while relative changes were strongest in the northernmost regions. In conjunction with shrub expansion, we observed herbaceous plant and lichen cover decline. Our results corroborate the perception of the replacement and homogenisation of Arctic vegetation communities facilitated by the competitive advantage of shrub species under a warming climate. The proposed method allows for multidecadal quantitative estimates of fractional cover at 30 m resolution, initiating new opportunities for mapping past and present fractional cover of tundra PFTs and can help advance our understanding of Arctic shrub expansion within the vast and heterogeneous tundra biome.}

abstract = {Land degradation is a major environmental and social issue in temperate steppes. It is commonly determined from vegetation cover using remote sensing techniques. Steppes in eastern Mongolia are subject to resource extraction activities, such as mining and oil extraction, which affect land degradation. Recent technological progress in remote sensing has facilitated the acquirement of high-resolution data by, for example, the CubeSat satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), providing data for detailed maps of vegetation cover and plant functional groups (PFGs). Traditional methods for monitoring vegetation cover often face typical scale issues, such as the upscaling of vegetation parameters if plot-scale field measurements are integrated to satellite data. Here, we studied the spatial distribution of PFG using machine learning and a combination of field measurements, UAV imagery (spatial resolution: 2 cm), and PlanetScope multi-temporal imagery. We provide two products at two spatial resolutions: one for UAV data, which is restricted to comparatively small areas around field measurements, and one for PlanetScope, which covers large parts of northeastern Mongolia. The results showed that the overall accuracies of UAV classification were 91–95%, whereas those of PlanetScope were 78–95%. In integrating the classified UAV data to the PlaneScope data, our proposed model minimized the scale issue that often impedes classification. Importantly, our findings revealed that the ecological effects of dirt road and railroad extended up to 60–120 m into the adjacent, otherwise less degraded steppe vegetation. A comparison between burned and unburned areas in different years indicates that wildfires affect the composition of PFG in reducing the fractional cover of graminoids and forbs, and that increasing cover of bare ground leads to a distinct and patchy mosaic of different vegetation types.}

In large landscapes, these limited methods may not capture the spatial and temporal variation of floral resources. Recent advances in sensors and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms offer opportunities to characterize the dynamic distribution of floral resources at the landscape level. In this study, UAV imagery and a multistep machine learning classification analysis were used to quantify floral resources in nonagricultural environments, where topography, vegetation, and inflorescence size were variable. Seven flowering species covering an area of 2 138 m2 were classified throughout our study, equaling 0.5% of the overall landscape. We determined the period of flowering for important species based on the temporal changes of the floral area classified from UAV images. Models performed well considering the extreme rarity of flowers in the UAV images. The flower class in the land cover classification models performed well with an average sensitivity of 0.77 and average specificity of 0.99. Individual flower classes also performed well with the majority of flower classes receiving sensitivity and specificity values of over 0.90. The use of UAVs is a feasible method for characterizing floral resources in nonagricultural settings. Classifications would benefit from a more robust and comprehensive UAV and floral resource sampling plan, to better characterize the variability of floral resources in UAV imagery.}

abstract = {A significant growth in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations has been observed over the past decade, largely driven by the emergence of new commercial opportunities and use-cases. This has posed new technological and regulatory challenges in order to address the complex safety, efficiency and sustainability requirements associated with UAS operations in an increasingly congested airspace. The growing need for trusted autonomy in UAS operations imposes demanding performance requirements on Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS), both in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. In most current NGS implementations, system autonomy is tightly constrained within a specified set of operational and environmental conditions through a large number of explicit rules. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods and the emergence of highly-parallelized processor boards with low form-factor has led to the opportunity to employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance navigation system performance, particularly for small UAS (sUAS), which account for the majority of current and future unmanned aircraft use-cases. sUAS navigation systems typically employ diverse low Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, MEMS-IMUs, magnetometers, cameras and Lidars for localization, obstacle detection and avoidance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of conventional sUAS navigation systems, including aspects such as system architecture, sensing modalities and data-fusion algorithms. Additionally, performance monitoring and augmentation strategies are critically reviewed and assessed against current and future UAS Traffic Management (UTM) requirements. The primary focus is on the identification of key gaps in the literature where the use of AI-based methods can potentially enhance navigation performance. A critical review of AI-based methods and their application to sUAS navigation is conducted, along with an assessment of the performance benefits they provide over conventional navigation systems. Reviewed methods include but are not restricted to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN and RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble techniques. The key challenges associated with adapting these methods to address sUAS operational objectives are clearly identified. The review also covers the assurance of predictable, deterministic system behaviour which is a key requirement to support system certification. The review and analysis will inform the reader of the applicability of various AI/ML methods to sUAS navigation and autonomous system integrity monitoring, and its likely role in the ongoing UTM evolution.}

At the same time, the access to such data and the tools needed to process them has considerably improved. In the presence of such data flow, we need automatic image interpretation methods, especially when it comes to the monitoring and prediction of environmental and societal changes in highly dynamic socio-environmental contexts. This could be accomplished via artificial intelligence. The concept described here relies on the induction of classification rules that explicitly take into account structural knowledge, using Aleph, an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) system, combined with a multi-class classification procedure. This methodology was used to monitor changes in land cover/use of the French Guiana coastline. One hundred and fifty-eight classification rules were induced from 3 diachronic land cover/use maps including 38 classes. These rules were expressed in first order logic language, which makes them easily understandable by non-experts. A 10-fold cross-validation gave significant average values of 84.62%, 99.57% and 77.22% for classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Our methodology could be beneficial to automatically classify new objects and to facilitate object-based classification procedures.}

The approach employed here utilizes Behavioral Cloning, a technique in which human pilots supply a series of sample maneuvers. These maneuvers serve as training data for a Machine Learning algorithm, enabling the system to generate control models for each maneuver. The optimal instances for each maneuver were chosen based on a set of objective evaluation criteria. By utilizing these selected sets of examples, resilient models were developed, capable of reproducing the maneuvers performed by the human pilots who supplied the examples. In certain instances, these models even exhibited superior performance compared to the pilots themselves, a phenomenon referred to as the “clean-up effect”. We also explore the application of transfer learning to adapt the developed controllers to various airplane models, revealing compelling evidence that transfer learning is effective for refining them for targeted aircraft. A comprehensive set of intricate maneuvers was executed through a meta-controller capable of orchestrating the fundamental maneuvers acquired through imitation. This undertaking yielded promising outcomes, demonstrating the proficiency of several Machine Learning models in successfully executing highly intricate aircraft maneuvers.

With layers of said protocols functioning as ”black boxes”, any form of interaction between non-adjacent layers constitutes a direct violation of the protocols’ architecture. The work presented in this survey intends to examine existing protocols of both legacy and cross-layer architectures in terms of their potential in accommodating routing in FANET deployments. Special attention is given to multi-altitude (3D) deployments, where a substantially greater amount of processing and packet route complexity is observed, and a greater amount of node location precision is required. The potential of cross-layer designs is expressed as a function of power budgeting, mobility (and awareness thereof), security, and resource allocation, given their importance for efficient control of flying ad hoc networks.}

Current management policies mainly focus on short-term restoration without considering how climate change might affect regeneration dynamics. We aimed to test the usefulness of ecological niche models (ENMs) to integrate the effects of climate change on tree species distributions into post-fire restoration planning. We also examined different important conceptual and methodological aspects during this novel process. We constructed ENM at fine spatial resolution (25 m) for the four main tree species (Pinus pinaster, Quercus pyrenaica, Q. faginea and Q. ilex) in an area affected by a megafire in Central Spain at two scales (local and regional), two periods (2 and 14 years after the fire) at the local scale, and under two future climate change scenarios. The usefulness of ENMs as support tools in decision-making for post-fire management was confirmed for the first time. As hypothesized, models developed at both scales are different, since they represent different scale dependent drivers of species distribution patterns. However, both provide objective information to be considered by stakeholders in combination with other sources of information. Local models generated with vegetation data 14 years after the fire provided valuable information about local and current vegetation dynamics (i.e., current microecology spatial niche prediction). Regional models are capable of considering a higher proportion of the climatic niche of species to generate reliable climate change forecasts (i.e., future macroclimate spatial niche forecast). The use of precise ENMs provide both an objective interpretation of potential habitat conditions and the opportunity of examining vegetation patches, that can be very valuable in managing restoration of areas affected by megafires under climate change conditions.}

In particular, we investigate neural networks that map five key parameters in fire spread to the first arrival time, and the corresponding inverse problem. By using simulated data, we are able to characterize the error, the required dataset size, and the convergence properties of these neural networks. For the inverse problem, we quantify the network’s sensitivity in estimating each of the key parameters.

abstract = {Semi-arid and arid systems cover one third of the earth’s land surface, and are becoming increasingly drier, but existing datasets do not capture all of the types of water resources that sustain these systems. In semi-arid environments, small surface water bodies and areas of mesic vegetation (wetlands, wet meadows, riparian zones) function as critical water resources. However, the most commonly-used maps of water resources are derived from the Landsat time series or single date aerial photographs, and are too coarse either spatially or temporally to effectively monitor water resource dynamics. In this study, we produced a Sentinel Fusion (SF) water resources product for a semi-arid mountainous region of the western United States, which includes monthly maps of both a) surface water and b) mesic vegetation at 10 m spatial resolution using freely available Earth observation data on an open access platform. We applied random forest classifiers to optical data from the Sentinel-2 time series, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 time series, and topographic variables. We compared our SF product with three commonly used and publicly available datasets in the western U.S. We found that our surface water class contained fewer omission errors than a leading global surface water product (94 % producer’s accuracy (PA) vs 84 %) and comparable user’s accuracy (UA) (91 % vs 97 %) with commission errors occurring largely in mixed water pixels. Our mesic vegetation class had up to 43 % higher PAs compared to the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) estimates and up to 78 % higher UAs over the Sage Grouse Initiative mesic resources maps during the most critical part of the water year. We found that while inclusion of SAR data from the C-band Sentinel-1 sensor consistently improved estimates of water resources in each of the last four months of the 2021 water year when compared to optical-only + topographic variables, only in September did those improvements lie outside of the 95 % confidence interval. With nine times finer spatial resolution and more frequent image collection, our SF maps characterize intra-annual dynamics of smaller water bodies (<30 m wide) and mesic vegetation integral to ecosystem functioning in semi-arid systems compared to leading Landsat-derived products. Further, our workflow is easily reproducible using freely available data on an open access platform, and can be adopted to help guide land use decisions related to water resources by farmers, ranchers, and conservationists in semi-arid environments.}

Since existing methods for automatic fault diagnosis require expensive sensors, they are only cost-effective for large-scale systems. To address these drawbacks, we propose a fault diagnosis model based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which monitors a group of PV systems by comparing their current and voltage production over the last 24h. This methodology allows for monitoring PV systems without sensors, as hourly measurements of the produced current and voltage are obtained via the PV systems’ inverters. Comprehensive experiments are conducted by simulating 6 different PV systems in Colorado using 6 years of real weather measurements. Despite large variations in number of modules, module type, orientation, location, etc., the GNN can accurately detect and identify early occurrences of 6 common faults. Specifically, the GNN reaches 84.6%±2.1% accuracy without weather data and 87.5%±1.6% when satellite weather estimates are provided, significantly outperforming two state-of-the-art PV fault diagnosis models. Moreover, the results suggest that GNN can generalize to PV systems it was not trained on and retains high accuracy when multiple PV systems are simultaneously affected by faults.}

Therefore, there is a high probability that more people will be exposed to and endangered by forest fires. Hence there is an urgent need to design pervasive systems that effectively assist people and guide them to safety during wildfires. This paper examines the potential of mobile applications to be employed to assist people to escape wildfires in real-time, by means of using and evaluating EscapeWildFire, a system for suggesting evacuation paths to mobile phone users in real-time. Two different evaluation strategies are followed: (a) Considering different areas of the island of Cyprus as case studies with simulated wildfires and actual users and (b) Considering a historic wildfire that occurred in Amarillo, Texas in 2011. Results in both cases show that mobile apps can effectively be employed to assist people to escape wildfires, but their use is heavily dependent on a backend system that supports the precise modelling of the wildfire. The time between the wildfire outbreak and the notification reaching the user is crucial for their safety. Various recommendations for improvements have been recorded based on either the feedback of participants in the case studies or the observations from the Texas wildfire. The code of the mobile app, backend and administration interface used are all open-source; fire authorities around the world are encouraged to further investigate this opportunity and adopt this approach.}

This paper presents a framework for the development and implementation of incident-level wildfire impact assessment of WUI residential structures including the following successive components: hazard, inventory, exposure, and impact. The hazard model generates spatial and temporal distribution of fire intensity for wildfire event scenarios; the inventory model provides spatial pattern of exposed structures; the exposure model estimates the fire intensity at WUI locations; whereas the impact model evaluates the structures loss by applying newly developed empirical response functions represented as the relationship between fire intensity, distance from forest edge and expected proportion of burned structures. A case study application of the proposed framework is presented for loss assessment of structures in a WUI community of the northern boreal forest of Canada. The proposed framework is particularly useful to the public safety community for conducting what-if scenarios of wildfire impact in support of emergency and mitigation planning.}

abstract = {This study addresses the critical need to enhance disaster preparedness and response, focusing on hurricane impact assessment and debris estimation. Accurate assessments in this context are critical for post-event search-and-rescue (SAR) operations and resource distribution. Recent computing advancements are revealing the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in collecting data and assisting with post-hurricane reconnaissance. However, the use of AI and UAV photogrammetry for accurate disaster impact analysis remains underexplored. To this end, this study proposes a damage and debris analysis framework harnessing reality capture through aerial imagery and photogrammetry. Within this framework, a region-based neural network is leveraged to detect debris locations in aerial imagery with favorable performance. In a testbed within the Beaumont-Port Arthur region, in Southeast Texas, this study performs 3D reality captures of the built environment. Since the accuracy of the 3D reality capture is of importance in research areas associated with time-sensitive disaster response, we further investigate the optimal 2D aerial imagery overlap ratio required to generate a sufficiently accurate 3D model for disaster impact analysis and debris volume estimation. Results indicate that, in the case of aerial imagery for infrastructure systems, a minimum of 60 % overlap is recommended for damage assessment and debris analysis. In contrast, for flat green areas, a minimum of 50 % overlap is adequate. Overall, for disaster response applications, our study reveals that an overlap ratio between 60 % and 70 % is optimal for achieving a balance between time efficiency and data quality in aerial data collection. These quantitative recommendations are crucial for enabling efficient disaster response efforts. Additionally, our study outcomes will improve disaster impact analysis and facilitating timely and effective response strategies.}

Our study sought to simulate rapidly spreading natural wildfire with fidelity and quality through computational realization. We developed a novel probabilistic wildfire risk assessment tool whose operation was driven by real-time wildfire observations. A Gaussian transformation incorporating present and historical geographical data to the wildfire model was adopted to accommodate scale differences in the datasets. The model outputs, therefore, depict possible spread pathways using Monte Carlo simulations. We created a computational solution for deploying wildfire simulations to a highly scalable, distributed and parallel computing framework, which facilitated a fairly linear increase in the simulation run time as the computation load increased exponentially. Our computational solution synthesized and fully automated the various stages of the process, from data preparation to analysis and visualization.

abstract = {The occurrence of forest fires can lead to ecological damage, property loss, and human casualties. Current forest fire smoke detection methods do not sufficiently consider the characteristics of smoke with high transparency and no clear edges and have low detection accuracy, which cannot meet the needs of complex aerial forest fire smoke detection tasks. In this paper, we propose Adjacent layer composite network based on a recursive feature pyramid with deconvolution and dilated convolution and global optimal nonmaximum suppression (ARGNet) for high-accuracy detection of forest fire smoke. First, the Adjacent layer composite network is proposed to enhance the extraction of smoke features with high transparency and no clear edges, and SoftPool in it is used to retain more feature information of smoke. Then, a recursive feature pyramid with deconvolution and dilated convolution (RDDFPN) is proposed to fuse shallow visual features and deep semantic information in the channel dimension to improve the accuracy of long-range aerial smoke detection. Finally, global optimal nonmaximum suppression (GO-NMS) sets the objective function to globally optimize the selection of anchor frames to adapt to the aerial photography of multiple smoke locations in forest fire scenes. The experimental results show that the ARGNet parametric number on the UAV-IoT platform is as low as 53.48 M, mAP reaches 79.03%, mAP50 reaches 90.26%, mAP75 reaches 82.35%, FPS reaches 122.5, and GFLOPs reaches 55.78.

abstract = {Fire managers seek accurate methods to map fire severity for forest management efforts. Fire severity data with wide spatial and temporal coverage enhances understanding of fire's impact on vegetation and improves planning to mitigate the risk of destructive wildfires. In this study, we develop a machine learning workflow that converts a spatial database of known fire events into a collection of gridded fire severity maps representing levels of canopy scorch due to wildfires and planned fuel reduction burns (prescribed burns). This workflow uses a dataset of observed fire severity interpreted from post-fire aerial images (3–7 cm spatial resolution; ~11,649 labels from 64 unique fires) to train and test a supervised classifier that predicts fire severity using 13 Landsat-derived spectral indices. For a target fire, the classifier generates a pixel-level prediction of fire severity with classes belonging to one of five ordinal categories ranging from unburnt, three levels of canopy scorch, and canopy consumed by fire. The classifier's accuracy was 84.2% (Kappa score = 0.799) and testing was undertaken across multiple fire types (wildfire / prescribed burn), seasons, forest types and topography. MODIS thermal anomalies and a MODIS-derived burn area product were used to augment the fire severity database with start- and end-of-fire dates to enable accurate delineation of pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery; this method increased model accuracy from 78.0% (Kappa = 0.72). The model was then applied to a regional 16-year (2005 to 2020) history of fire events (n fires = 713, ~1Mha) in the sclerophyll eucalypt forests and woodlands of the Northern Jarrah Forest, Western Australia. On fires with MODIS-adjusted start and end dates, high severity fire (>80% canopy scorch) was predicted more often in wildfires (67.9%, 124900 ha) compared to prescribed burns (14.6%, 110300 ha). However, the total predicted area of high-severity fire was comparable between fire types due to prescribed burns being more frequent on the landscape. We provide the first fire severity model in Western Australia that is broadly calibrated to both prescribed burns and wildfires across multiple conditions. Our model outputs are made freely available and offer opportunities to better understand the interactions between prescribed burns and wildfires, and the effects of fire severity on the environment.}

SBIoT has various applications to make human life smarter such as health care IoT, smart cities, agriculture, automated industries, security etc. The sensor collects data by monitoring a natural phenomenon from the environment and the internet is used to communicate that to the end-user. Much research has been done to detect events in such environments. The present work surveys diverse methodologies designed to capture the events of interest from collected data in different application domains of SBIoT. This paper revisits the understanding of detecting events of interest using SBIoT framework and discusses the detailed requirements for event detection. Further, different types of events have been identified, discussed and categorization is made. The authors observed the need to put the different categories of event detection in one paper so that researchers can get idea about state of art of the domain. Previously published surveys focused on a specific domain of event detection such as Health IoT, security in SBIoT, agriculture IoT etc. Further such works defined the occurrences in the deployed field as events of interest in very narrow terms. Thus in most of the existing surveys, the event definition is mostly domain-specific and the focus is on the application area rather than techniques of event detection. Thus, there existed a gap for a holistic survey that conceptualizes different application domains into atomic categories and integrates different techniques available for SBIoT using a common thread of event detection. Hence, the event-based monitoring frameworks in SBIoT are segregated and diversified Event detection models are discussed based on the application domains. The paper describes event detection challenges and methodologies in different domains i.e rule-based, probability and statistics based, multimedia-based, intelligent system based and signal processing based methodologies. Further, the comparative analysis of various recently proposed methods has been carried out in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The present work also discusses the existing research gaps in the domain of event detection and the authors believe that it will be helpful for researchers in academia and industry to develop new methodologies.}

abstract = {Small satellites enable many important applications for both economic and scientific purposes. Many of these applications are inherently data-centric and rely on large amounts of high-resolution satellite imagery to be delivered in a timely manner. However, communicating this data to Earth is challenging due to intermittent connectivity, high packet losses, low data rates, and similar issues. Therefore, efficient onboard prioritization and data processing are essential for future satellite missions. Machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks, are very suitable for such prioritization, as they are already used extensively for satellite imagery processing and they can be deployed onboard of satellites. However, updating them to support new classification requirements when the satellite is already in orbit is difficult, as often multiple passes are required to complete model transmission due to the communication challenges. To cope with this issue, we propose a progressive transmission mechanism for model updates, which leverages vector quantization and arithmetic coding. Our mechanism allows to achieve high accuracies even with partially updated models. Evaluation results show that our mechanism significantly outperforms other less optimized transmission schemes.}

Accurately monitoring vegetation change is thus crucial, but scale mismatches between field and satellite-based monitoring cause challenges. Remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a bridge between field data and satellite-based mapping. We assessed the viability of using high-resolution UAV imagery and UAV-derived Structure from Motion to predict cover, height, and aboveground biomass (henceforth biomass) of Arctic plant functional types (PFTs) across a range of vegetation community types. We classified imagery by PFT, estimated cover and height, and modeled biomass from UAV-derived volume estimates. Predicted values were compared to field estimates to assess results. Cover was estimated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.29%–14.2%, and height was estimated with an RMSE of 3.29–10.5 cm depending on the PFT. Total aboveground biomass was predicted with an RMSE of 220.5 g m−2, and per-PFT RMSE ranged from 17.14 to 164.3 g m−2. Deciduous and evergreen shrub biomass was predicted most accurately, followed by lichen, graminoid, and forb biomass. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using UAVs to map PFT biomass, which provides a link towards improved mapping of PFTs across large areas using earth observation satellite imagery.
Les communautés végétales de l’Arctique changent rapidement avec le réchauffement climatique, ce qui influence la faune, le cycle du carbone et les rétroactions climatiques. Il est donc crucial de surveiller avec précision les changements de la végétation, mais les disparités d’échelle entre la surveillance sur le terrain et la surveillance par satellite posent des défis. La télédétection à partir de véhicules aériens sans pilote (UAV) est apparue comme un pont entre les données de terrain et la cartographie par satellite. Les auteurs évaluent la viabilité de l’utilisation de l’imagerie haute résolution par des UAV et de la structure acquise à partir du mouvement (SfM – Structure from Motion) d’UAV pour prédire la couverture, la hauteur et la biomasse hors-sol (ci-après biomasse) de types fonctionnels de plantes (PFT — Plant functional types) de l’Arctique dans une gamme de types de communautés végétales. Ils ont classé l’imagerie par PFT, estimé la couverture et la hauteur, et modélisé la biomasse à partir des estimations de volume obtenues par UAV. Les valeurs prédites ont été comparées aux estimations sur le terrain pour évaluer les résultats. La couverture a été estimée avec écart moyen quadratique (EMQ) de 6,29-14,2 % et la hauteur a été estimée avec un EMQ de 3,29-10,5 cm, selon le PFT. La biomasse hors-sol totale a été prédite avec un EQM de 220,5 g m-2, et l’EQM par PFT variait de 17,14 à 164,3 g m-2. La biomasse des arbustes à feuilles caduques et à feuilles persistantes a été prédite avec le plus de précision, suivie par la biomasse des lichens, des graminoïdes et des herbes non graminéennes. Ces résultats démontrent l’efficacité de l’utilisation d’UAV pour cartographier la biomasse de PFT, ce qui établit un lien vers cartographie améliorée des PFT sur de grandes superficies grâce à l’imagerie satellitaire d’observation de la terre.

The acquired data can be formed into a digital cultural heritage cube, which enables timely access to any desired data. Additional information can be derived from the accumulated data through image fusion processes and the ancestors’ knowledge encapsulated in cultural properties. To verify this, we explored two disasters—arson and forest fires—in Korea. We concluded that, if the proposed method is applied to cultural properties, the damage to culture assets can be minimised and their resilience can be enhanced.}

abstract = {The area burned in Spain exceeded historical records in 2022, when exceptionally warm conditions influenced wildfire events. The predicted intensification of wildfire regimes includes an increase in frequency, severity, and size. Therefore, a study of the wildfires that occurred in 2022 is necessary to understand their behaviour and possible environmental impacts. The objective of this study is to analyse the applicability of using spectral indices and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches to map the spatial distribution and estimate potential soil losses using Sentinel-2 imagery and fire severity field data. Soil losses were estimated using an empirical model based on soil burn severity data collected in the field after wildfire. The relationship between the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Difference Normalized Wildfire Ash Index (dNWAI), and the Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI) with the estimated soil losses was then evaluated. In addition, the influence of different time scales of the satellite images was analysed. The first period considered (Date I) ranges from 8 to 20 days after the beginning of the wildfire, which coincides with the field data collection. The second period considered (Date II) ranges from 28 to 35 days after the start of the wildfire. The results obtained showed a significant dependence relationship between the BNDVI index (using satellite images of Date I) and the estimated soil losses (R2 = 0.756), while the results of the NDII (R2 = 0.31) and dNWAI (R2 = 0.061), showed no spatial relationship with the estimated soil losses. Three of the largest wildfires in 2022 in Spain were analysed, and the results showed strong correlations of BNDVI index for Folgoso do Courel (R2 = 0.808), for Carballeda de Valedorras (R2 = 0.906), and for Sierra de la Culebra (R2 = 0.939). In addition, these results allowed the mapping and quantification of potential soil losses in areas where fire severity was high, totalling ∼2,50,000 Mg ha−1 in Folgoso do Courel, ∼3,70,000 Mg ha−1 in Carballeda de Valdeorras, and ∼4,70,000 Mg ha−1 in Sierra de la Culebra. Moreover, BNDVI values for estimating soil loss vary by vegetation type, and there is a positive correlation between severity classes and the BNDVI index. This approach can inform post-fire land management decisions in future wildfires and could be applied to other regions.}

They are related to the exchange of information and occur as a side effect of system technologies and the alerting process. Fires often are associated with considerable damages. Because time is a critical factor, detection is often accomplished by installed Spatio Wildfire Prediction and Monitoring System (SWPMS). The highly sensitive sensors in fire detectors make the identification of fires in a nearly stage possible, but this also makes SWPMS susceptible to false alarms. So far there is no reliable evidence on the ratio of false alarms to installed fire detection and fire alarm systems in SWPMS. The studies, which are described in the present paper, close this gap for Visakhapatnam on the basis of an empirical analysis of data from fire brigades. It is difficult to describe the ratio in one single value, because a great number of conditions and influencing factors are relevant. To reduce the false alarm ratio, we need a common understanding of false alarms and a consistent use of terms and categories.}

Good correlations were found between field measured values and pixel counts from manually segmented photos delineating a pre-defined set of 10 discrete cover types. Although promising, segmenting photos manually was labor intensive and therefore costly. We explored the viability of using a trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to perform image segmentation automatically. The DCNN was able to segment nadir images with 95% accuracy when compared with manually delineated photos. To validate the flexibility and robustness of the automated image segmentation algorithm, we applied it to an independent dataset of nadir photographs captured at a different study site with similar surface vegetation characteristics to the training site with promising results.}

Many forecasting techniques predict fire activity and allocate prevention resources, but various factors are missing from the assessments, and multi-criteria decision approaches alone are insufficient. This work introduced a novel methodology combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP multi-criteria methods, and spatial data to detect potential forest fire vulnerability areas using twenty variables. The results from AHP or fuzzy AHP, were processed using a multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation algorithm. The final ANN model has two objectives: first, to create a forest fire vulnerability with four classes (low, moderate, high, and very high), and second, to classify burned area sizes in regions highly or very highly vulnerable to fire. Evaluation metrics were also applied for validation. The fire model was tested using both literature review data and in situ observations. Comparative analysis showed that the burned area size model performed better than other machine learning methods, achieving an accuracy score of 89%. Meanwhile, the fire vulnerability model scored 82%. The study addresses the problem of prediction and provides an algorithm for classifying fire risk based on historical data in the Czech Republic, offering a master model for future forest management. Therefore, the ANN model, once trained, validated, and tested, does not require resetting and is effective for estimating forest fire vulnerability. Moreover, it produces results quickly, providing rapid insights into complex forest ecosystems, saving time and enhancing understanding for decision-makers.}

This paper presents a multidisciplinary analysis of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Along with the latest observations and simulation studies, we synthesize the time-series and event progressions during the accident across multiple disciplines, including in-plant physics and engineering systems, operators’ actions, emergency responses, meteorology, radionuclide release and transport, land contamination, and health impacts. We identify three key factors that exacerbated the consequences of the accident: (1) the failure of Unit 2 containment venting, (2) the insufficient integration of radiation measurements and meteorology data in the evacuation strategy, and (3) the limited risk assessment and emergency preparedness. We conclude with new research and development directions to improve the resilience of nuclear energy systems and communities, including (1) meteorology-informed proactive venting, (2) machine learning-enabled adaptive evacuation zones, and (3) comprehensive risk-informed emergency planning while leveraging the experience from responses to other disasters.}

Its abundance depends on the associated chemical pathways, local environmental conditions, and meteorological factors, the latter of which affects the dispersal of O3. This research investigates vertical and horizontal variations in NO2 and O3 in urban and rural areas associated with atmospheric parameters at 13 monitoring locations stretching from greater Bangkok to Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. O3 and NO2 were measured concurrently with temperature and relative humidity using calibrated portable devices (Aeroqual, Series 500), typically at heights of 1.5, 75, and 110 m. The instruments were mounted on a drone to obtain measurements at elevations of 75 m and 110 m. The data obtained showed that even in the lowest part of the boundary layer, the average concentrations of O3 in the urban area increased by nearly 21% with altitude from the ground (26.8 ± 4.7 ppb at 1.5 m) to 110 m. However, in the rural area, the average ground concentrations of O3 were higher (38.6 ± 11.8 ppb) but they decreased by approximately 43% at 110 m. Notably, at all monitoring sites, NO2 concentrations exhibited a decreasing trend with height above the ground. As the wind conditions were stagnant, the ground measurements at each station were representative of local conditions. However, modelling of air mass backward trajectories indicated that despite the stagnant conditions at the ground level, there were contributions from long-range transport (even within the shallow atmospheric layers) at elevations as low as 110 m above the ground.}

We highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between biotic and abiotic factors that accelerate these processes and the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address this issue. We also identify a range of challenges intrinsic to WPE management, including the need for deeper insights into the catalysts of WPE and their impacts on ecohydrological connectivity across diverse ecosystems. This review also emphasizes the role of remote sensing in monitoring WPE and the potential of modeling approaches to inform management decisions. We highlight the significance of comprehending regional nuances, and the influences of climate change, and encourage the development of strategies to improve collaboration among stakeholders engaged in management initiatives. We also reiterate the necessity of integrating the human dimension, including policy formulation and landowner perspectives, into effective WPE management and restoration projects. We advocate for a holistic, integrated approach to shaping the future of rangeland management in an ever-evolving global landscape.}

The study was carried out within a large (14,000ha) area in central Sweden burnt in August 2014, where we had access to airborne lidar data from both 2011 and 2015. Three data-sets of predictor variables were tested: POST (post-fire lidar metrics), DIF (difference between post- and pre-fire lidar metrics) and combination of those two (POST_DIF). Fractional logistic regression was used to predict the proportion of fallen trees. Training data consisted of 61 plots, where the number of fallen and standing trees was calculated both in the field and with interpretation of drone images. The accuracy of the best model was tested based on 100 randomly selected validation plots with a size of 25×25m. Our results showed that multi-temporal lidar together with field-collected training data can be used for quantifying post-fire tree felling over large areas. Several height-, density- and intensity metrics correlated with the proportion of fallen trees. The best model combined metrics from both datasets (POST_DIF), resulting in a RMSE of 0.11. Results were slightly poorer in the validation plots with RMSE of 0.18 using pixel size of 12.5m and RMSE of 0.15 using pixel size of 6.25m. Our model performed least well for stands that had been exposed to high-intensity crown fire. This was likely due to the low amount of echoes from the standing black tree skeletons. Wall-to-wall maps produced with this model can be used for landscape level analysis of fire effects and to explore the relationship between fallen trees and forest structure, soil type, fire intensity or topography.}

This research aims to improve these vehicles' ability to identify pollution sources and develop strategies, with a focus on transportation-related pollution. Detailed air pollution tests revealed that pollutant concentrations surged during morning rush hours, especially in high-traffic coastal areas, while areas away from traffic had much lower levels. Evening tests showed that pollutants from daytime traffic had dispersed throughout the urban area. The consistent northward shift in pollutant concentrations underscored the link between traffic patterns and pollutant distribution. Quantitative analyses and the resulting air pollutant maps showed average increases in pollutant concentrations between morning and evening hours in high-traffic areas: 12.1% for NO2, 5.3% for CO, 9.8% for PM10, and 11.4% for PM2.5. In contrast, the increases in pollutant concentrations in less trafficked urban regions were 45.9%, 48.2%, 32.7%, and 29.5%, respectively. This demonstrates how air pollution originating from areas with heavy traffic impacts other regions through environmental and geographical factors. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive air quality management strategies at the city level, targeting emissions in high-traffic areas and adapting to temporal fluctuations in pollutant levels.}

These techniques facilitate the interpretation and understanding of decisions made by AI models, promoting transparency and trust. However, the current state of XAI applications in DRM, their achievements, and the challenges they face remain underexplored. In this systematic literature review, we delve into the burgeoning domain of XAI-DRM, extracting 195 publications from the Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, and selecting 68 for detailed analysis based on predefined exclusion criteria. Our study addresses pertinent research questions, identifies various hazard and disaster types, risk components, and AI and XAI methods, uncovers the inherent challenges and limitations of these approaches, and provides synthesized insights to enhance their explainability and effectiveness in disaster decision-making. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the use of XAI techniques for DRM in 2022 and 2023, emphasizing the growing need for transparency and interpretability. Through a rigorous methodology, we offer key research directions that can serve as a guide for future studies. Our recommendations highlight the importance of multi-hazard risk analysis, the integration of XAI in early warning systems and digital twins, and the incorporation of causal inference methods to enhance DRM strategy planning and effectiveness. This study serves as a beacon for researchers and practitioners alike, illuminating the intricate interplay between XAI and DRM, and revealing the profound potential of AI solutions in revolutionizing disaster risk management.}

This study aims to optimize the residual biomass supply chain by leveraging digitalization's advantages, thereby creating a new model for this purpose. Methodologically, this research initially adopted an empirical approach, analyzing documents from a project that recreated the current scenario. In its second phase, the study involved a literature review to gather insights needed for developing the final model. Consequently, this study offers three major contributions: a detailed mapping of the current scenario, a comprehensive synthesis of the potentials of emerging technologies in the supply chain, and a model illustrating the integration of these technologies in the context of residual biomass. Thus, this research presents an opportunity to transform a common ‘leftover’ into a value-added material. To better assess the model's value, two analyses, PEST and SWOT, were conducted to align the conceptual proposal with real-world contexts.}

The existing regulations in western Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy) were used to identify and define the wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas, quantifying the people inhabiting them and estimating the population affected by burned areas from 2001 to 2017. We used the Google Earth Engine to process MODIS products and extract both burned areas and land covers. We detected that 25% of the urban population inhabits WUI areas (i.e. Biobío, Araucanía and Valparaíso regions) where the urban population exposed to burned areas exceeds 40%. Most of the land use and land covers affected by wildfires are anthropogenic land covers, classified as savannas, croplands, evergreen broadleaf forests and woody savannas, representing >70% of the burned areas. Urban areas show only 0.6% of the burned surface from 2001 to 2017. We estimate that 55,680 people are potentially affected by wildfires, and 50% of them are in just one administrative region. These results show the imperative need for public policies as a regulating force for establishing WUI areas with the purpose of identifying wildfire risk in urban areas, such as establishing prevention methods as firewalls and prescribed fires.}

Preventing illegal deforestation activities is an emergent and crucial mission for the world. Recently, automated monitoring systems using Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) appear as a promising solution to combat deforestation. However, the quality design of such systems considering the deforestation prevention impacts remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose a socio-ICT (Information Communication Technology) model that enables to analyze the deforestation prevention impacts of a UAV-based monitoring system quantitatively. The socio-ICT model uses a causal loop diagram to formulate the relations among system quality measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with deforestation prevention. Through the numerical study, we estimate the effectiveness of the UAV monitoring system by annual deforestation rate and CO2 gas emissions. Our analysis shows important design trade-offs need to be considered when planning UAV-based monitoring systems.}
