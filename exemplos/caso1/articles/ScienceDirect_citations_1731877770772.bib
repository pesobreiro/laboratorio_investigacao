abstract = {The climate and weather dynamics in the past few years has driven a massive increase in the number and intensity of flood disasters, which severely claim casualties in human, goods and properties. Aimed to reduce these casualties, emerging software-defined internet protocol-based communication technologies in the form of Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted strong interests from disaster mitigation stakeholders to rapidly locate victims and acquire their relevant information, which in turn can boost up the efficiency and effectiveness of Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. In order to capture state-of-the-art development and technological challenges, this paper presents an extensive review on the flood SAR systems, highlighting some of the key emerging IoT technologies that prove or are potentially useful in improving the SAR operation by the rescuers. Furthermore, a comprehensive study on different existing communication technologies for SAR is provided, covering the system architecture, communication network compositions and applications. Based on the critical analysis of existing works, this paper puts forward a proposal on an IoT-aided integrated flood management framework to support SAR in the flood-catchment areas, leveraging upon three-domain (ground, water and air) collaborative wireless networks.}

Flood management is widely recognized as an effective way to reduce the adverse consequences, and a more resilient and sustainable flood management approach has been the goal in recent studies. This study used a detailed bibliometric analysis of keywords, terms and timelines in the research field of the flood research. It provides new insight into the flood research trends, by examining the research frontiers from 2000 to 2021. We conclude that the trend of flood research has experienced a transition from flood control to flood resilience. The review shows that flood research has moved from traditional flood management, which provides mitigation strategies, to flood risk management, which provides an adaptation approach—adjusting mitigation measures, to flood resilience management, which provides a more resilient and sustainable plan to cope with flood disasters. We also present a detailed overview of the field of flood research, and review the definition of risk, risk analysis methods, flood management, flood risk management, flood resilience, and corresponding implementation strategies. We conclude that integrating the concept of resilience into the framework of risk management is a better approach in future flood management directions. Consequently, appropriate options and decisions prior to disaster, during disaster, and post-disaster will effectively reduce the adverse consequences using the theory of risk, resilience, and sustainability.}

abstract = {One of the biggest challenges to deal with the global crisis of biodiversity loss is the lack of efficient and viable monitoring systems across scales. Unlike traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring, a usually costly and time-consuming enterprise, satellite remote sensing (SRS) data offer a technically feasible and sustainable in time solution. Here, we devise a cost-effective and upgradeable spatiotemporal framework for monitoring the species-specific habitat availability changes across scales by trend analysis of habitat suitability index (HSI) derived from ecological niche models (ENMs; Maxent) and using time series of SRS data (MODIS). The SRS-ENM framework was applied for a large suite of native species (911), from major taxonomic groups (flora (vascular plants), amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), and listed in the IUCN Red List at regional (Iberian Peninsula) and continental (Europe) scales. The HSI-trend analyses predict cumulative reductions in habitat suitability for Threatened and Non-Threatened species across scales for the period 2002–2016. Specifically, 19% and 66% of the total grid cells for both species' groups showed negative trends at both regional and continental scales, respectively. Results were similar when considering all IUCN threat categories. All taxa groups showed a decrease in habitat suitability, but amphibians and reptiles groups hosted the largest number of negative HSI-trends grid cells. Considering all groups together, 12% and 34% of both study areas have strong reductions in habitat quality. We conclude that our framework detects increases and decreases in species' habitat suitability regardless of the spatial scale, extent, and pixel size. Species' range predictions across space and time based on SRS time series represent a promising Earth observation tool to support traditional risk assessment protocols and anticipate the decision-making process, while serving as a cross-scale biodiversity monitoring system.}

It follows the necessity of gathering raw, massive and heterogeneous environmental data which we obtained, while middleware processes must merge context modelling and reasoning seamlessly. We proposed a system supporting mountain rescuers which is demanding due to the large number of environmental objects interacting, as well as high data variability. We presented complex context processing embedded in the proposed context life cycle and implemented it in a difficult mountain environment. We introduced five weather scenarios which are a basis for contextual and perceptual processing during the validation of our model. The system merges a message streaming broker for massive data transport, low and high-level processing algorithms, repositories and a logical SAT solver. It constitutes a Context-Aware-as-a-Service (CAaaS) system, offering advanced support for mountain rescue operations. The provided software model defines middleware components which act on a predicted context and transform in situ sensor data into smart decisions, and which could operate as a platform-based cloud computing model. It is an enabler yielding a synergy effect with different software components orchestration when providing pro-activeness and non-intrusiveness concerning smart decisions.}

This paper investigates a new routing problem of small UAVs for information collection with time windows, where UAVs can be recharged at platforms (e.g. ground vehicles or stations) distributed in a given area. Different from the previous works on UAV routing, the UAVs are allowed to partially recharge their batteries according to the requirement in the following route. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed to formulate the problem, where the overall time for completing all targets’ observation and the number of UAVs are minimized. An improved adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm with simulated annealing strategies is designed, and a recharging platform insertion heuristic is developed to determine the recharging strategy and construct feasible solutions. To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, a set of new benchmark instances are designed based on the well-known Solomon data set and solved. The computational results are compared with those obtained by the ant colony optimization and variable neighborhood search, which shows that ALNS performs significantly better and stable. Furthermore, experimental analysis indicates that important advantages can be obtained through introducing the recharging strategy for small UAVs.}

This work comprehensively explores the current landscape of resilience evaluation and metrics within the power distribution system domain, reviewing existing methods and identifying key attributes that define effective resilience metrics. The challenges encountered during the formulation, development, and calculation of these metrics are also addressed. Additionally, this review acknowledges the intricate interdependencies between power distribution systems and critical infrastructures, including information and communication technology, transportation, water distribution, and natural gas networks. It is important to understand these interdependencies and their impacts on power distribution system resilience. Moreover, this work provides an in-depth analysis of existing research on planning solutions to enhance distribution system resilience and support power distribution system operators and planners in developing effective mitigation strategies.

First responders’ life threats when accessing the attacked zone are more severe in comparison to other disasters and the accuracy of basic information such as the number of terrorists, the number of trapped people, their locations and identity, etc., is vital to the reduction of the response time. Recent technologies for PSNs are designed to manage natural disaster scenarios; these are not best suited for situations like terrorist attacks because a proper communication infrastructure is required for operating most of the classical PSNs. This serious concern makes it highly desirable to develop reliable and adaptive pervasive public safety communication technologies to counter such a kind of emergency situation. Device-to-device (D2D) communication can be a vital paradigm to design PSNs that are fit for dealing with terrorist attacks thanks to long-term evolution (LTE)-sidelink, which could allow the devices that people carry with themselves in the attacked zone to communicate directly. To our best knowledge, this is the first survey paper on public safety communication in the context of terrorist attacks. We discuss PSN scenarios, architectures, 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) standards, and recent or ongoing related projects. We briefly describe a system architecture for disseminating the critical information, and we provide an extensive literature review of the technologies that could have a significant impact in public safety scenarios especially in terrorist attacks, such as beamforming and localization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), LTE sidelink for both centralized (base-station assisted) and decentralized (without base-station) architectures, multi-hop D2D routing for PSN, and jamming and anti-jamming in mobile networks. Furthermore, we also cover the channel models available in the literature to evaluate the performance of D2D communication in different contexts. Finally, we discuss the open challenges when applying these technologies for PSN.}

abstract = {Characterization of forest structure is important for management-related decision making, monitoring, and adaptive management. Increasingly, observations of forest structure are needed at both finer resolutions and across greater extents to support spatially explicit management planning. Unmanned aerial system (UAS) based photogrammetry provides an airborne method of forest structure data acquisition at a significantly lower cost and time commitment than existing methods such as airborne laser scanning (LiDAR). This study utilizes nearly 5000 stem-mapped trees in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) dominated forests to evaluate several algorithms for detecting individual tree locations and characterizing crown area across tree sizes. Our results indicate that adaptive variable window detection methods with UAS-based canopy height models have greater tree detection rates compared with fixed window analysis across a range of tree sizes. Using the UAS approach, probability of detecting individual trees decreases from 97% for dominant overstory to 67% for suppressed understory trees. Additionally, crown radii were correctly determined within 0.5 m for approximately two-thirds of sampled trees. These findings highlight the potential for UAS photogrammetry to characterize forest structure through the detection of trees and tree groups in open-canopy ponderosa pine forests. Further work should investigate how these methods transfer to more diverse species compositions and forest structures.
Il est important de caractériser la structure forestière pour éclairer les décisions de gestion, le suivi et la gestion adaptative. De plus en plus, des observations de la structure forestière sont nécessaires, tant à des résolutions plus fines que sur de plus vastes étendues, pour soutenir une planification de gestion spatialement explicite. La photogrammétrie basée sur des systèmes aériens sans pilote (SASP) fournit une méthode aéroportée d’acquisition de données sur la structure forestière à un coût et un investissement en temps nettement inférieurs à ceux des méthodes existantes telles que le balayage laser aéroporté. Cette étude utilise près de 5 000 tiges d’arbre cartographiées, dans des forêts dominées par le pin ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson), pour évaluer plusieurs algorithmes de détection de l’emplacement des arbres individuels et de caractérisation de la surface de la couronne des arbres de différentes tailles. Nos résultats indiquent que les méthodes adaptatives de détection à fenêtre variable avec des modèles de hauteur du couvert forestier sur la base des données de SASP ont des taux de détection d’arbres plus élevés que l’analyse à fenêtre fixe pour un assortiment de tailles d’arbres. Avec l’utilisation des SASP, la probabilité de détecter des arbres individuels passe de 97 % pour l’étage dominant à 67 % pour les arbres opprimés du sous-étage. De plus, les rayons de la couronne ont été correctement déterminés, à moins de 0,5 m, pour environ les deux tiers des arbres échantillonnés. Ces résultats mettent en évidence le potentiel de la photogrammétrie basée sur les SASP pour caractériser la structure forestière grâce à la détection d’arbres et de groupes d’arbres dans les forêts de pins ponderosa dont le couvert n’est pas fermé. Des travaux supplémentaires devraient étudier comment ces méthodes peuvent s’appliquer à des compositions d’espèces et des structures forestières plus diverses. [Traduit par la Rédaction]}

Dendroecological observations of tundra shrubs can provide insight into current and past growth and recruitment patterns, both key components for understanding and predicting ongoing and future Arctic shrub dynamics. However, generalizing these dynamics is challenging as they are highly scale-dependent and vary among sites, species, and individuals. Here, we provide a perspective on how some of these challenges can be overcome. Based on a targeted literature search of dendrochronological studies from 2005 to 2022, we highlight five research gaps that currently limit dendro-based studies from revealing cross-scale ecological insight into shrub dynamics across the Arctic biome. We further discuss the related research priorities, suggesting that future studies could consider: 1) increasing focus on intra- and interspecific variation, 2) including demographic responses other than radial growth, 3) incorporating drivers, in addition to warming, at different spatial and temporal scales, 4) implementing systematic and unbiased sampling approaches, and 5) investigating the cellular mechanisms behind the observed responses. Focusing on these aspects in dendroecological studies could improve the value of the field for addressing cross-scale and plant community-framed ecological questions. We outline how this could be facilitated through the integration of community-based dendroecology and dendroanatomy with remote sensing approaches. Integrating new technologies and a more multidisciplinary approach in dendroecological research could provide key opportunities to close important knowledge gaps in our understanding of scale-dependencies, as well as intra- and inter-specific variation, in vegetation community dynamics across the Arctic tundra.}

It is an effort to resolve the best feasible trajectory between the source and the destination while prohibiting collision in a dynamic environment. Many researchers have proposed different deterministic and non-deterministic solutions to the path-planning problem. However, it is still open to new promising methods to acquire better quality solutions with minimum time complexity. This article presents a novel methodology inspired by the Reverse Glowworm Swarm Optimization (RGSO) algorithm to resolve this problem for the UAV without colliding with any dynamic and static obstructions appearing in its path. A tuned path is generated after the initial one to optimize further and smoothen the trajectory. The proposed method has been extensively experimented with, and the outcomes show it outperforms the other algorithm in a three-dimensional dynamic environment in a path-planning strategy. The result shows that our proposed scheme reduces the value of the cost function by approximately 49% - 107% less than other existing approaches, and the execution time of this mechanism reduces by 2% - 61% compared with other existing methods. Thus, the proposed technique RGSO-UAV is an optimal and energy-efficient path-planning model in flying ad-hoc networks that enhance UAV's lifetime.}

Inspired by those earlier botanists such as Darwin conceiving this concept when observing plants outdoors, we propose to track Darwin's footprints – go again to the wild where plants show higher-fold adapting performance than in labs for arousing a re-cognition of PI. However, this plan must face a basic challenge on in-situ plant phenotyping, especially in structure, which serves as the three-dimensional (3D) phenomenological display of varying PI behaviors. Aiming at this core bottleneck, we suggest to go but with 3D remote/proximal sensing (R/PS) devices such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) – a state-of-the-art technology of fully but fine mapping plants, for starting a 3D cognition of PI. Further, to decode the mechanism of PI occurring, we preview the next-generation (e.g., hyperspectral, fluorescence, and polarization) LiDAR with the latent capacity on all-round phenotyping of plants. Their derived 3D biochemical, physiological, and biophysical functional traits can arouse a beyond-3D cognition of PI. Overall, this theoretical prospect, with the available R/PS technology traced for upgrading PI from conceptual debating to mechanistic understanding, can advance the PI field into its 3D and even beyond-3D times and bring the PI and PI-relevant sciences such as sustainability cognition to breathe new life.}

abstract = {Thaw slumps are clear indicators of rapid permafrost degradation. They form preferentially in near-surface ice-rich permafrost of northern high latitudes after initial thermal disturbance by the subsequent interplay of thermal (thawing of frozen deposits and melting of ice) and mechanical (slumping and erosion) processes. The largest known thaw slump on Earth – the Batagay megaslump – has been identified in sloping terrain on the Yana Upland in northern Yakutia. Its initiation began in the 1980s, with a current area of >0.8 km2. It continues to grow and has headwall retreat rates of up to 15 m per year. While various satellite remote sensing studies of the Batagay thaw slump have been undertaken, on-site studies characterizing internal landforms, terrain changes, and geomorphic processes have not yet been conducted. To fill this knowledge gap and to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of very large thaw slumps, our study employs on-site observations and detailed permafrost sampling combined with unoccupied aerial vehicle data from 2019. The latter were used to generate an orthomosaic, a digital surface model, hypsometric slope profiles and a map of relief types in the thaw slump. Within the Batagay thaw slump, the dynamic relationship between headwall morphology and slump floor is largely determined by the cryolithological structure of the permafrost horizons exposed across the headwall rising up to 55 m above the slump floor. Factors include the thickness and overall high volumetric ground-ice content (up to 87 %) of the cryostratigraphic horizons. Furthermore, the diurnal and seasonal insolation exposure of the headwall perimeter superimposes both thermal denudation activity and meltwater transport of eroded material. Thus, recent degradation patterns are linked to permafrost properties. Therefore, the Batagay thaw slump is not only a window into Earth's past as it reveals ancient permafrost, but its modern dynamics highlight that ongoing rapid permafrost thaw under present Arctic warming is directly influenced by its Quaternary geological and permafrost history.}

Although there are disaster management institutions and related policies in place to deal with disasters; however, need to be enhanced by the use of state-of-the-art technologies. The interdisciplinary nature of disaster management and technology has hindered the rapid deployment of technological solutions in this domain. However, recently, the trend has been shifted and technology has been widely used to support disaster management activities. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are one of the potential technological platforms which can efficiently be used to facilitate the disaster management process. This chapter addresses the emerging role of UAVs in disaster management applications and highlights essential aspects to be considered. Some highlighted concepts discussed under this chapter include UAVs classification, potential sensory equipment, regulations related to UAVs, hardware considerations of UAVs, and applications of UAVs in different disaster management activities. In addition, the chapter also highlights a few crucial challenges related to UAVs that need consideration in the context of disaster management applications.}

In this regard, this review advocates for cross-site cross-network collaborations in CZ sciences. We posit that this type of collaboration is becoming indispensable for understanding past trends and future trajectories of the CZ, in the context of fast-developing and widespread environmental changes. Aided by a series of cyberseminars and a community survey, we highlight some of the existing cross-site initiatives, tools and techniques, and the cross-cutting science questions that could benefit from such cross-network syntheses, in various types of CZ settings (montane, alpine, arctic, managed and agricultural environments, lakes, wetlands, streams, landscapes disturbed by drought and/or wildfire, etc.). This review also identifies and discusses the major and legitimate concerns and obstacles for a collaborative CZ approach, including data harmonization and integration of social sciences, and proposes tentative ways forward.}

One Biosecurity is an interdisciplinary approach to policy and research that builds on the interconnections between human, animal, plant, and ecosystem health to effectively prevent and mitigate the impacts of invasive alien species. To support this approach requires that key cross-sectoral research innovations be identified and prioritized. Following an interdisciplinary horizon scan for emerging research that underpins One Biosecurity, four major interlinked advances were identified: implementation of new surveillance technologies adopting state-of-the-art sensors connected to the Internet of Things, deployable handheld molecular and genomic tracing tools, the incorporation of wellbeing and diverse human values into biosecurity decision-making, and sophisticated socio-environmental models and data capture. The relevance and applicability of these innovations to address threats from pathogens, pests, and weeds in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems emphasize the opportunity to build critical mass around interdisciplinary teams at a global scale that can rapidly advance science solutions targeting biosecurity threats.}

This development has been due to physicists venturing outside of their traditional domains of interest, but also due to scientists from other disciplines taking from physics the methods that have proven so successful throughout the 19th and the 20th century. Here we characterise the field with the term ‘social physics’ and pay our respect to intellectual mavericks who nurtured it to maturity. We do so by reviewing the current state of the art. Starting with a set of topics that are at the heart of modern human societies, we review research dedicated to urban development and traffic, the functioning of financial markets, cooperation as the basis for our evolutionary success, the structure of social networks, and the integration of intelligent machines into these networks. We then shift our attention to a set of topics that explore potential threats to society. These include criminal behaviour, large-scale migration, epidemics, environmental challenges, and climate change. We end the coverage of each topic with promising directions for future research. Based on this, we conclude that the future for social physics is bright. Physicists studying societal phenomena are no longer a curiosity, but rather a force to be reckoned with. Notwithstanding, it remains of the utmost importance that we continue to foster constructive dialogue and mutual respect at the interfaces of different scientific disciplines.}

abstract = {The ocean plays a central role in modulating the Earth’s carbon cycle. Monitoring how the ocean carbon cycle is changing is fundamental to managing climate change. Satellite remote sensing is currently our best tool for viewing the ocean surface globally and systematically, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, and the past few decades have seen an exponential growth in studies utilising satellite data for ocean carbon research. Satellite-based observations must be combined with in-situ observations and models, to obtain a comprehensive view of ocean carbon pools and fluxes. To help prioritise future research in this area, a workshop was organised that assembled leading experts working on the topic, from around the world, including remote-sensing scientists, field scientists and modellers, with the goal to articulate a collective view of the current status of ocean carbon research, identify gaps in knowledge, and formulate a scientific roadmap for the next decade, with an emphasis on evaluating where satellite remote sensing may contribute. A total of 449 scientists and stakeholders participated (with balanced gender representation), from North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Sessions targeted both inorganic and organic pools of carbon in the ocean, in both dissolved and particulate form, as well as major fluxes of carbon between reservoirs (e.g., primary production) and at interfaces (e.g., air-sea and land–ocean). Extreme events, blue carbon and carbon budgeting were also key topics discussed. Emerging priorities identified include: expanding the networks and quality of in-situ observations; improved satellite retrievals; improved uncertainty quantification; improved understanding of vertical distributions; integration with models; improved techniques to bridge spatial and temporal scales of the different data sources; and improved fundamental understanding of the ocean carbon cycle, and of the interactions among pools of carbon and light. We also report on priorities for the specific pools and fluxes studied, and highlight issues and concerns that arose during discussions, such as the need to consider the environmental impact of satellites or space activities; the role satellites can play in monitoring ocean carbon dioxide removal approaches; economic valuation of the satellite based information; to consider how satellites can contribute to monitoring cycles of other important climatically-relevant compounds and elements; to promote diversity and inclusivity in ocean carbon research; to bring together communities working on different aspects of planetary carbon; maximising use of international bodies; to follow an open science approach; to explore new and innovative ways to remotely monitor ocean carbon; and to harness quantum computing. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive scientific roadmap for the next decade on how satellite remote sensing could help monitor the ocean carbon cycle, and its links to the other domains, such as terrestrial and atmosphere.}

Despite the importance of the firefighter's SA, there have been limited research efforts to understand what cues and information firefighters use to assess ongoing situations and predict future conditions. In addition to fire events, contemporary firefighters respond to an increasing volume of non-fire incidents. Thus, this study aims to identify firefighters' SA during three fire incidents (single house fire, vehicle fire, and passenger aircraft fire) and three non-fire incidents (medical emergency, hazardous materials, and urban search and rescue). A goal-directed task analysis was conducted via focus group discussions with eight career firefighters. Findings indicate that firefighters build their SA by processing various cues from hazards (e.g., fire, ignition source), humans (e.g., occupants, bystanders, drivers, passengers), spatial elements (e.g., building structure, location of hazards), and surrounding conditions (e.g., traffic, weather). Our findings provide insights into SA measurement, SA-oriented work processes, training for SA, and designing technologies to support firefighters' SA during all-hazard responses.}

In recent years, with the increasing popularity and use of social media, people have started to express their views, experiences, images, and video evidences through different social media platforms. Consequently, harnessing such crowdsourced information has become an opportunity for authorities to obtain enhanced situation awareness data for efficient disaster management practices. Nonetheless, the current disaster-related Twitter analytics methods are not versatile enough to define disaster impacts levels as interpreted by the local communities. This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by applying and extending a well-established data analysis framework, and identifying highly impacted disaster areas as perceived by the local communities. For this, the study used real-time Twitter data posted during the 2010–2011 South East Queensland Floods. The findings reveal that: (a) Utilising Twitter is a promising approach to reflect citizen knowledge; (b) Tweets could be used to identify the fluctuations of disaster severity over time; (c) The spatial analysis of tweets validates the applicability of geo-located messages to demarcate highly impacted disaster zones.}

The purpose of this work is to evaluate the evolution and current state of research on multi-hazard indices associated with climate-related hazards, highlighting their crucial role in effective risk assessment amidst the growing challenges of climate change. A notable gap in cross-regional comparative studies persists, presenting an opportunity for future research to enhance global understanding and foster universal resilience strategies. However, a significant surge in research output is apparent, following key global milestones related to climate change action. The research landscape is shown to be highly responsive to international policy developments, increasingly adopting interdisciplinary approaches that integrate physical, social, and technological dimensions. Findings reveal a robust emphasis on geospatial analysis and the development of various indices that transform abstract climate risks into actionable data, underscoring a trend towards localized, context-specific vulnerability assessments. Based on dataset systematically curated under the PRISMA guidelines, the review explores how prevailing research themes are reflected in influential journals and author networks, mapping out a dynamic and expanding academic community. Moreover, this work provides critical insights into the underlying literature by conducting a thematic analysis on the typology of studies, the focus on coastal areas, the inclusion of climate change scenarios, the geographical coverage, and the types of climate-related hazards. The practical implications of this review are profound, providing policymakers and practitioners with meaningful insights to enhance climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts through the application of index-based methodologies. By charting a course for future scholarly endeavours, this article aims to strengthen the scientific foundations supporting resilient and adaptive strategies for regions worldwide facing the multifaceted impacts of climate change.}

abstract = {On 17 March 2018 major grassland fires in south-west Victoria, Australia ignited several peat bogs. The peat fires smouldered for 40 days, generating substantial amounts of smoke. The surrounding communities were exposed to significant concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5), resulting in the need for active interventions (such as the relocation of schools) in order to protect vulnerable communities. The peat fires provided a unique opportunity to review the capabilities of two air pollution forecasting models to assess the impact from the peat fires on nearby communities: the Air Quality Forecasting System (AQFx) and the Accident Reporting and Guiding Operational System (ARGOS) Both systems are used in Victoria to inform emergency management response strategies and community warnings. A key configuration change was made to the smoke emissions module in AQFx from simulating emissions from a planned burn to a sub-surface peat fire. Emissions were derived by using heat maps generated from aerial imagery data and estimates of fuel load determined by the peat bulk density and depth of the peat. The results indicated that AQFx successfully captured most smoke plume events during the simulation period, despite some errors in timing and magnitude. Accurate forecasting was most challenged by calm conditions, and meso-scale meteorological transition events. The ARGOS model performed better at capturing the smoke plume dispersion during a meso-scale meteorological transition event due to meteorological forecasts being updated every 6 hours compared to a 24-h update in AQFx. However, the source geometry in ARGOS meant that emission rates were concentrated within a small number of release points resulting in relatively narrow plumes with a likely overprediction of higher end PM2.5 concentrations. The AQFx system was better suited to area emissions. The ARGOS and AQFx models showed different strengths in providing timely information to emergency response agencies to better manage smoke impacts from smouldering peat fires on communities. The ARGOS model can be set up quickly with preliminary emission estimates that can be adjusted as more accurate and updated information becomes available. Compared to the ARGOS model, AQFx is better suited for area emissions. Implementation of a rapid update cycle in AQFx would further improve forecasts especially during meteorological transition events.}

But the increasing use of these technologies and data also provokes major ethical and social justice questions. In this scoping review, we examine the extent to and ways in which ethics and justice are discussed in relation to uses of remote sensing in conservation. Our literature search identifies only 31 peer-reviewed English language papers containing substantive discussion of justice and/or ethics and conservation remote sensing. Within these papers, emergent themes and tensions include the use of remote sensing technologies for surveillance (and the extent to which this is framed as positive or negative), the militarised associations of remote sensing technologies, the ways that remote sensing technologies can disrupt or harden power asymmetries, and whether the greatest ethical risks or benefits are seen as being for people or other species. Building on recommendations identified in this review, we reflect on how conservation can learn from work on data ethics in other fields, such as the ethics of artificial intelligence. We also discuss the mechanisms (such as formal laws, journal review procedures, and greater individual reflexivity) which could support the use of remote sensing technologies and data to advance socially just conservation. Finally, we highlight research priorities including the need for more comparative case study analyses, greater research efforts on the political economy and geopolitics of conservation remote sensing, and work which situates novel technologies within longer-standing debates about ethics and philosophies of biodiversity conservation.}

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely utilized for surveying various sediment disasters, and the high-resolution imaging they provide reveals detailed topographic characteristics. However, the availability of multitemporal UAV observations, which reveal geomorphological changes before and after the disaster, is still limited. In this research, we performed multitemporal UAV observations for geomorphological changes before and after extreme postfire heavy rain in the Ozaki Peninsula wildfire area in Japan. Significant geomorphological changes were observed associated with eight landslides and stream shifting, with a spatial resolution of 0.30 cm obtained by structure from motion (SfM) processing. To extract the surface changes based on multitemporal UAV observations, in addition to elevation displacement, vertex normal vectors were calculated for each mesh. We found that the elevation displacement showed comprehensive alterations in the entire area and that the changes in vertex normal vectors effectively captured the shape of these alterations. Deterioration, deposition, and scarping were shown for landslides, and the dynamics of erosion and deposition in the cross-section were for stream shifting. In addition, the detected geomorphological changes were compared with the predisaster topographic characteristics. Landslides occurred with a catchment area of 500 to 2,000 m2 and a slope inclination of 30 to 40°, and stream shifting occurred with a catchment area of 10,000 m2 or more and a slope inclination of less than 20°. In both regions affected by landslides and stream shifting, the logarithmic stream power index (logSPI), a natural logarithmic representation of the conventional stream power index (SPI), could describe the characteristics roughly. A logSPI value of 4 to 5 represented landslides, and 5 and greater represented stream shifting, with the probability of landslides and stream shifting occurring in areas with these values exceeding 99.5% and 99.9%, respectively. Therefore, the logSPI was utilized to roughly classify the terrain and geomorphological condition and the points among the unburnt, unlogged-burnt, and logged-burnt areas were compared. Even when the logSPI was similar, the damage was much more severe in the burnt areas. On slopes with a logSPI of approximately 4, there were signs of erosion in the logged-burnt area, and the increase in fallen trees was significant in the unlogged-burnt area, while there were no substantial changes in the unburnt area. In valleys with a logSPI of 8 or greater, sediment and woody debris were significantly deposited in the burnt areas following the postfire rain, while there were few changes in the unburnt area.}

To support IoT requirements, UAVs must be capable of aggregating, processing, and transmitting data in real-time basis. As not only the number of IoT devices but also the amount of data to be collected is increased, data aggregation is of great importance. Recently, the UAV can also function as a mobile edge computing server in association with aerial data aggregation. This paper is the first to survey the various aspects and techniques of UAV-based aerial data aggregation for IoT networks. After addressing key design issues, we review the existing data aggregation techniques along with possible future direction. They are then compared with each other in terms of major operational features, performance characteristics, advantages, and limitations. Open issues and research challenges are also discussed with possible solution approaches.}

The inaccessibility of large parts of terrain despite the urgent need of support immediately following a disaster poses one of the major hindrances during the management process. Over the years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being used to provide aid in many disaster management operations and help increase the effectiveness of a disaster response. This chapter highlights the various uses of UAVs in disaster management applications. This has been done by grouping the existing and possible applications of UAVs based on the various roles played by them during disaster preparedness and management, namely, coverage and information gathering, resource dispatch and survivor rescue, and communication. The chapter also provides insight into the various coverage algorithms, sensing systems, and communication architectures which UAVs can potentially use in disaster management. In addition to these, the core hardware requirements of the UAVs are discussed as well as the challenges that need to be overcome in order to improve their role in disaster management operations.}

These incidents have a negative impact on system infrastructure and lead to significant economic losses. Thus, the power community has accelerated research on mitigating these impacts on power systems. This paper presents an extensive review of recent literature on the evaluation, metrics, and enhancement of power system resilience. To improve power system resilience, this paper discusses hardening and operational strategies for various groups, addressing the main challenges. Hardening strategies focus on the physical hardiness of the power grid and aim to reduce the magnitude of high-impact, low-probability events, while operational strategies aim to minimize restoration time. Additionally, the paper examines microgrid strategies for enhancing power system resilience, classifying them based on local and global resilience and providing a detailed comparison of microgrids for global resilience-based restoration and microgrids for local resilience-based self-healing strategies. This paper presents the different objective functions, constraints, and optimization methods used in the modelling process. Moreover, the evaluation metrics to assess resilience are examined. The research shows that microgrid technology has a high potential to improve power system resiliency against major events.}

Management must be flexible and adaptive in response to uncertainties and variation. The effects of management actions need to be monitored on the ground and/or with new methods such as remote sensing or modeling. Many rangelands are affected by constant vegetation changes, soil degradation, and social and environmental changes (climate change).

abstract = {Despite advances in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) efficiencies, multiple contaminants of concern, such as microplastics, pharmaceuticals, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) remain largely untreated near discharge points and can be highly concentrated before they are fully mixed within the receiving river. Environmental agencies enforce mixing zone permits for the temporary exceedance of water quality parameters beyond targeted control levels under the assumption that contaminants are well-mixed and diluted downstream of mixing lengths, which are typically quantified using empirical equations derived from one-dimensional transport models. Most of these equations were developed in the 1970s and have been assumed to be standard practice since then. However, their development and validation lacked the technological advances required to test them in the field and under changing flow conditions. While new monitoring techniques such as remote sensing and infrared imaging have been employed to visualize mixing lengths and test the validity of empirical equations, those methods cannot be easily repeated due to high costs or flight restrictions. We investigated the application of Lagrangian and Eulerian monitoring approaches to experimentally quantify mixing lengths downstream of a WWTP discharging into the Rio Grande near Albuquerque, New Mexico (USA). Our data spans river to WWTP discharges ranging between 2-22x, thus providing a unique dataset to test long-standing empirical equations in the field. Our results consistently show empirical equations could not describe our experimental mixing lengths. Specifically, while our experimental data revealed “bell-shaped” mixing lengths as a function of increasing river discharges, all empirical equations predicted monotonically increasing mixing lengths. Those mismatches between experimental and empirical mixing lengths are likely due to the existence of threshold processes defining mixing at different flow regimes, i.e., jet diffusion at low flows, the Coanda effect at intermediate flows, and turbulent mixing at higher flows, which are unaccounted for by the one-dimensional empirical formulas. Our results call for a review of the use of empirical mixing lengths in streams and rivers to avoid widespread exposures to emerging contaminants.}

abstract = {Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing platform based on geo-information applications in the ‘cloud’. This platform provides free access to huge volumes of satellite data for computing, and offers support tools to monitor and analyse environmental features on a large scale. Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, processing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the citation impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals reveals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers towards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta-analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22%). A low number of articles about COVID-19, in spite of the planetary importance of the pandemic effects. The reviewed articles were geographically distributed among 86 countries, China, United States, and India accounting for the large number. ‘Remote Sensing’ and ‘Remote Sensing of Environment’ were the leading journals in the citation impact metrics, while the Random Forest method and the agriculture-related applications being the mostly cited. It is expected that these results might change over the mid to long term, due to fast progress in environmental and spatial information technologies, although currently our findings may be worthwhile and useful for assessing the current global deployment of GEE platform.}

Digital technologies monitor and regulate the electrical grid more effectively and reliably, yet the power grid is exposed to risk from cybersecurity and includes complex cyber-physical interdependency. CPPS challenges need modeling and rigorous analysis of a complex cyber-physical interaction. Traditional modeling, training, and analysis separate physical and cyber domains, which is unsuitable for current CPPS. Thus, an integrated framework was required to analyze the real situation of physical-cyber system unification. This study reviews modeling, simulation, analysis, cyberattacks, and cybersecurity measures for current CPPS. This study reviews realistic power system cyberattack detection and mitigation control techniques. Finally, CPPS research worldwide and a new route for suggestions and investigation directions for CPPS researchers are offered.}

To optimize the efficiency and longevity of PV systems, it is imperative to comprehend the causes and impacts of distorted irradiation, as it serves as a primary factor contributing to the partial shade effect in photovoltaic power conversion. This article offers an in-depth analysis of shading on photovoltaic modules, categorizing it as either temporary or permanent. The study also evaluates various mitigation techniques to address efficiency losses resulting from shading. Temporary shading can be mitigated by implementing cleaning and dust-repelling techniques for PV modules, while permanent shading can be reduced through PV reconfiguration techniques. This article critically reviews the most common and recent shading mitigation techniques, including PV panel cleaning and array reconfiguration techniques, and provides an economic analysis of these methods. Moreover, the paper offers useful recommendations for deploying appropriate PV cleaning techniques in different countries, based on their climatic conditions. The study suggests optimal shading mitigation techniques and cleaning cycles for different climatic regions. In a nutshell,this investigation adds to an enhanced understanding of the effects of shade on PV systems and gives significant recommendations for future technological development and improvement. The proposed state-of-the-art study is useful for PV engineers to propose a suitable PV panel cleaning technique by accessing the background, nature, and type of shading.}

The capabilities of the Mobile Positioning Data tool (1) to increase risk awareness in rescue planning and emergency management in cyber-hazard situations and (2) to help in locating and evacuating tourists and other vulnerable people in disasters was evaluated. The capabilities of the Trasim tool to help in crisis communications training for improving preparedness and tackling mis/disinformation through simulated responses was evaluated. The evaluation indicated that there are a lot of innovation potential and useful technical enablers for improving disaster risk awareness and resilience, but there are also ethical challenges, and risks for misuse. The digital divide between people in the unequal distribution of skills and access to technological means and tools remains an essential future challenge, especially with vulnerable people in a crisis. Issues of fairness and inclusivity need great attention in the application of these technologies in crises or disasters in order not to overlook such vulnerable people. The failure in critical infrastructures (e.g., energy and communications) seems to increase risks and exacerbate the situation of vulnerable people in crises. However, the potential of technological opportunities for improving operation in disasters is so essential that significant investment in research and development is recommended.}

Specifically, the proposed multi-methodological approach integrates a syncretic risk perception conceptual model with a household-based group utility evolution model. The dynamics of household evacuation route choice are explored in two stages, namely the individual utility initiation and accommodation. The unique feature of the proposed approach is that it links individual risk perception, survival psychology, and group behavioral dynamics together to characterize household decision-making about choosing the evacuation routes. An empirical study coupled with experiments is conducted to help validate the proposed household evacuation route choice behavior model. Through various designed disaster scenarios, the applicability and strengths of the proposed model for mass evacuation planning and management are demonstrated. Particularly, the mean relative prediction errors of the proposed model with respect to household-based evacuation route switching probability and path flow splits are 3.79% and 6.88%, respectively, all within an acceptable range of ±10 %. This demonstrates that the proposed model and analytical results align closely with household choice behavior.}

However, baseline metrics to gauge pollinator health in the wild amidst rapid climate change are lacking. Our laboratory-based study establishes a baseline for pollinator physiological state by exploring how osmotic conditions influence survivorship in a desert hawkmoth pollinator, Manduca sexta. We sampled hemolymph osmolality from over 1000 lab-grown moths at 20 %, 50 %, and 80 % ambient humidity levels. Starved moths maintained healthy osmolality of 350–400 mmol/kg for 1–3 days after eclosion regardless of ambient humidity, but it sharply rose to 550 mmol/kg after 4–5 days in low and moderate humidity, and after 5 days in high humidity. Starved moths in low humidity conditions perished within 5 days, while those in high humidity survived twice as long. Moths fed synthetic Datura wrightii nectar, synthetic Agave palmeri nectar, or water, maintained osmolality within a healthy range of 350–400mmol/kg. The same was true for moths fed authentic floral nectars from Datura and Agave plants, although moths consumed more synthetic than authentic nectars, possibly due to non-sugar constituents. Simulating a 4-day mismatch between pollinator emergence and nectar availability, a single nectar meal osmotically rescued moths under dry ambient conditions. Our findings highlight hemolymph osmolality as a rapid and accurate biomarker distinguishing dehydrated from hydrated states in insect pollinators.}

It has the means to respond and facilitate environmental management, and makes sound and evidence-based decisions in relation to Earth's resources at a global scale and across different continents, nations, and domains. Remote sensing currently supplies essential Earth observations to protect irreplaceable resources and provide support for sustainable economic growth, disaster resilience, management of energy and mineral resources, food and water security, and sustainability. It provides powerful tools for understanding the past and present conditions of Earth systems and components, as well as the interplay between them. Thus remote sensing could assist us to solve environmental problems, address and mitigate risks, and deliver skillful predictions of the future behaviors of Earth systems (natural disasters, state of oceans, atmosphere, land, vegetation, food, public health, etc.). And by translating these Earth observations into decision making, remote sensing could help mobilize actions to mitigate effects to the benefit of human race.}

This study investigated changes in fire season pattern (i.e., the number of separate periods of a year when wildfires are most likely to ignite, spread, and affect resources) and the contributions of climate change in Daxing'anling, Northeast China. An expanded fire dataset in both spatial and temporal converge from ground reporting was used. A comparison with satellite detected burned areas showed good agreement in spring, summer, and entire fire season. The results showed that the number of fires used to appear in a bimodal pattern with spring and fall peaks in the last century, but transitioned to a unimodal pattern peaked in summer in this century. This conversion was mainly resulted from a remarkable increase in summer lightning fires, which was in turned associated with warming in Daxing'anling. Another factor for the conversion was decreased spring nonlightning fire occurrence in the northwest subregion, where the conversion was the most significant. This decrease of fire was mainly associated with increased precipitation. The analysis of a compositional fire series, built as the log of the ratio of lightning to nonlightning fires, suggests that climate change was a major factor for the conversion of fire season pattern. The finding from this study indicates a need to adjust the fire prevention implementation timeline by including summer fires and to develop strategies to reduce the related risks to firefighter safety and forest ecosystem health in Daxing'anling.}

abstract = {Chile is a global biodiversity hotspot and hosts a large proportion of the southern hemisphere’s temperate forests. The Chilean Valdivian temperate forest is a vulnerable ecosystem containing a highly ecologically valuable species assemblage. Productive forest plantations have involved deforestation of, and alien species introduction into, this ecosystem. This process has already severely impacted the western part of Chile (the Coastal Range) and is now occurring in the eastern part (the Andes), with forestry plantations promoted by government subsidies between 1974 and 2012. Archive Landsat satellite imagery classification and Google Earth Engine are used to assess land cover change over a 31-year period with a focus on alien species (Pinaceae and Eucalyptus spp.) spread and native (Nothofagus spp. and Araucaria araucana) deforestation. Results show a clear land cover pattern based on elevation: a higher altitude, relatively undisturbed area dominated by native forest (the Andes), and a lower altitude area where most human activity and related land covers are located (the valley area). The valley is highly dynamic because of constant land cover change due to forestry. Overall, Araucaria araucana cover has decreased over the study period, while Nothofagus spp. has remained relatively stable. Alien Pinaceae has decreased, while Eucalyptus spp. has remained stable. However, the results indicate that change analysis over long periods conceal dynamism. For example, Eucalyptus spp. sharply decreased between the 1980s and the 1990s and surged afterwards. Also, even though Nothofagus spp. cover dominates throughout the study period, change analysis shows a high degree of change in the valley area, indicating newly established Nothofagus spp. patches. Over the study period, long rotation Pinaceae plantations for timber have given way to shorter rotation forestry (alien Eucalyptus spp., native Nothofagus spp.) for pulp and local uses resulting from discontinuation of forest subsidies. In the absence of subsidies, only large-scale plantations can engage in long rotation forestry, as smallholders need the more stable income provided by shorter rotation forestry. Although higher elevations (the Andes) are dominated by native forest, several abandoned alien forest plantations may be the source of biological invasion. In addition, native forest degradation as a result of Araucaria araucana loss and shrub encroachment is occurring. Earth observation methods are key for forest and alien species monitoring and landscape management. They can enhance traditional, ground-based forest surveys and provide continuous and even retrospective monitoring of forest change thanks to the wide availability of current and historical satellite data.}

abstract = {Climate change has led to a dramatic increase in extreme events worldwide. Predictions for a + 1.5 °C world indicate that 13.8% of the global population will be exposed to heat waves (HWs), a proportion rising to 36.9% in a + 2 °C scenario. At present, about 9.6 M people in the EU and UK are exposed to extreme heat every year. Overheating has various impacts on cities, including urban infrastructure failures and changes in ecological processes. However, scarce attention is currently paid to the distribution of HWs impacts and the differential vulnerabilities of different social groups, raising the issue of climate justice in cities. HWs directly impact the health of the most vulnerable social groups resulting in an increase in mortality and morbidity rates. This research focuses on the city of Padua (Italy) as a pilot study to assess the effects of urban HWs and heat islands (UHI) combined. By framing the unequal spatial distribution of socially vulnerable groups, this study aims to i) provide a replicable spatially explicit open-access methodology to assess the heat-related risk of UHI; ii) propose the first climate justice heat-related risk index to be adopted in inclusive and just adaptation plans. Specifically, it aims to i) identify HWs and map critical hotspots during summer 2022 at suburban scale; ii) assess the spatial correlations among impervious areas and UHI; iii) map the climate risk to vulnerable social groups; and iv) propose a global climate justice risk index for all the vulnerable groups considered. Images from Landsat 8–9 were processed, and territorial data were acquired from public databases. It was found that three extreme HWs hit Padua in summer 2022, on 2–7 June, 21–23 July, and 4–8 August, when maximum temperatures were 35.1 °C, 36.1 °C, and 35.8 °C, respectively. The intensity and magnitude of UHIs were considerable, with land surface temperatures of 33.8 °C on average (σ = 1.7, min = 27.9, max = 41.4). UHI intensity reached 5–8 °C of difference with rural contexts, mainly in strongly urbanized sectors. Ordinary least squares regression indicated a positive correlation with impervious surfaces, with a β coefficient showing an average increase of 0.3 °C per 10% of soil sealing. Six different hotspots were identified both in industrial areas and within the city centre. However, the integrated climate risk analyses highlight that most critical areas are in sectors where there is a large number of the elderly, migrants, children, and low-income households. Our findings reveal the need for urgent heat island mitigation measures and that the distributive dimension of climate justice should be respected in adaptation planning.}

Remote sensing has revolutionized the understanding of our dynamic environment. When aerial photography, which had been available since the early 20th century, was supplemented by digital satellite-borne imagery in the 1970s, the range of remotely sensed earth observation (EO) techniques grew. Since many environmental remote sensing systems are publicly sponsored and the number of nations investing in EO infrastructure is rising, the number of EO systems designed to observe and monitor environmental processes is increasing, and governments are strongly promoting this science. Support for EO among the general population is largely fueled by environmental concerns. The reverse is true as well, since EO stimulates environmental awareness and concern.}

Cost-effective monitoring is challenging because of the long design life for surface barriers, spatial limitations and finite lifetime of in situ sensors, and performance metrics related to drainage. Hence, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) tools were evaluated for use in performance monitoring of surface barriers. GPR and EMI were used to non-invasively interrogate the Prototype Hanford Barrier (PHB), an evapotranspiration-capillary break barrier established in 1994 at the Hanford Site, in southeastern Washington State. Both geophysical methods were evaluated for providing indirect estimates of subsurface moisture content conditions that were compared to point scale measurements from borehole neutron logs. Surveys were performed during characteristically wet and dry periods to observe a range of hydrologic states of the barrier soil. Although EMI surveys were expected to show seasonal changes associated with changes in the bulk conductivity of the barrier soil layers, the effectiveness of the method was limited by the effects of metallic infrastructure embedded in the barrier. GPR estimates of volumetric water content were typically within 2–3% of the highest water contents from neutron probe measurements for both wet and dry periods, providing reasonable estimates of water content. Given that PHB monitoring data over the past 25 years has demonstrated its success in limiting deep drainage, GPR was found to be a cost-effective method for demonstrating continued barrier performance, with a greater capacity to quantify moisture content distributions over much larger areas relative to point measurements.}

The wildfires jeopardize general wellbeing, security, and require high levels of government resources. They also lead to noteworthy debasement of nature, property loss, and high rates of human death and injury. This paper proposes an algorithm to use and route unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to mitigate forest fire risks. The developed matheuristic algorithm hybridizes simulated annealing and local search metaheuristics with an integer linear programming model. The mathematical model was developed to solve the distance-constrained multi-based multi-UAV routing problem, and because of the complexity of the problem, the generated metaheuristics helps the model to find better solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed matheuristic is tested with a real-life case study for Turkey and is also compared with a genetic algorithm. The Turkish State Meteorological Service generates forest fire-risk maps countrywide every day to predict fire risks 3 days later by using meteorological data. These maps are used to generate the risky regions to be visited by the UAVs, and the existing airports are considered for the UAVs to take off and land. The algorithm is coded using MATLAB and ILOG. The metaheuristics are designed with problem-based operators, and their parameters are tuned by experiments. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the hybridization procedures. Results demonstrate that the CPU times for the methods are acceptable.}

A field study in the Kitchener/Waterloo region inspired the development of a framework that has three underlying systems encompassing digital tools for data collection and analysis: (1) The Real Environment uses 3D scanners and a spreadsheet software, (2) The Model Environment uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) software and a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool, and (3) The Core Engine uses an optimization program. Real-world data collected from RCM stores (The Habitat for Humanity) and NCM stores (The Home Depot) are used for a realistic demonstration of the framework. By practically applying the framework to source window and door components for a modeled multi-residential building design, an integrated selection of 35% RCMs and 65% NCMs was proposed for the building design. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed for validation. The framework may disrupt the ongoing building design practices that deem material reuse problematic by enabling flexible sourcing of used and new building materials. A modular and iterative framework for facilitating reuse is thus contributed.}

abstract = {Semi-arid and arid systems cover one third of the earth’s land surface, and are becoming increasingly drier, but existing datasets do not capture all of the types of water resources that sustain these systems. In semi-arid environments, small surface water bodies and areas of mesic vegetation (wetlands, wet meadows, riparian zones) function as critical water resources. However, the most commonly-used maps of water resources are derived from the Landsat time series or single date aerial photographs, and are too coarse either spatially or temporally to effectively monitor water resource dynamics. In this study, we produced a Sentinel Fusion (SF) water resources product for a semi-arid mountainous region of the western United States, which includes monthly maps of both a) surface water and b) mesic vegetation at 10 m spatial resolution using freely available Earth observation data on an open access platform. We applied random forest classifiers to optical data from the Sentinel-2 time series, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from the Sentinel-1 time series, and topographic variables. We compared our SF product with three commonly used and publicly available datasets in the western U.S. We found that our surface water class contained fewer omission errors than a leading global surface water product (94 % producer’s accuracy (PA) vs 84 %) and comparable user’s accuracy (UA) (91 % vs 97 %) with commission errors occurring largely in mixed water pixels. Our mesic vegetation class had up to 43 % higher PAs compared to the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) estimates and up to 78 % higher UAs over the Sage Grouse Initiative mesic resources maps during the most critical part of the water year. We found that while inclusion of SAR data from the C-band Sentinel-1 sensor consistently improved estimates of water resources in each of the last four months of the 2021 water year when compared to optical-only + topographic variables, only in September did those improvements lie outside of the 95 % confidence interval. With nine times finer spatial resolution and more frequent image collection, our SF maps characterize intra-annual dynamics of smaller water bodies (<30 m wide) and mesic vegetation integral to ecosystem functioning in semi-arid systems compared to leading Landsat-derived products. Further, our workflow is easily reproducible using freely available data on an open access platform, and can be adopted to help guide land use decisions related to water resources by farmers, ranchers, and conservationists in semi-arid environments.}

In this study, we applied ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) canopy heights with ancillary Landsat, LANDFIRE (Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools) and topographic variables to produce a spatially explicit 30-m canopy height product across the contiguous United States. We used a gradient-boosted trees regression model with ancillary datasets as predictors to model and predict canopy height across various vegetation biomes. Overall, the fitted model achieved an R2 value of 0.76, a mean bias of 0.1 m, a general over-estimation, and MAE (mean absolute error) of 2.5 m on a hold-out validation dataset of 21,185 observations. Model performance varied across biomes (R2 = 0.49–0.73, mean biases = −0.3 to 0.8 m, MAE = 1.4 to 3.3 m). Independent accuracy assessment with airborne lidar (R2 = 0.72, MAE = 3.9 m) and canopy height models from the NEON program (R2 = 0.67, MAE = 6.9 m) also showed generally consistent agreement. In general, our developed canopy height product performed better in relatively homogenous environments or dense forests such as mangroves, flooded, coniferous or broadleaf and mixed forests than in relatively sparse environments associated with deserts, and chapparal forests. The generated canopy height product, designated as the continental canopy height map (CCHM), is publicly available and contributes to spatially explicit canopy height datasets over the US at an enhanced 30 m Landsat spatial resolution.}

Remote sensing products can help to scale-up ecological understanding to support management actions that need to be implemented across large spatial extents. This new avenue for remote sensing applications requires careful consideration of sources of potential bias that can lead to spurious causal relationships. We propose that causal inference techniques can help to mitigate biases arising from confounding variables and measurement errors that are inherent in remote sensing products. Adopting these statistical techniques will require interdisciplinary collaborations between local ecologists, remote sensing specialists, and experts in causal inference. The insights from integrating 'big' observational data from remote sensing with causal inference could be essential for bridging biodiversity science and conservation.}

Free- and medium-resolution satellite imagery is a useful tool that allows scientific researchers and management organizations to monitor forest development in developing countries, such as Vietnam. In this study, we used SPOT 4 and Planet remote sensing data to assess land-use status fluctuations in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau area, Vietnam, between 2000 and 2021 (the overall accuracy was 90.52%, Kappa value = 0.89). The results showed that from 2000 to 2010, the rate of natural forest loss in this area was 0.32%/year, of which, more than 6500 ha were converted to other uses. Between 2010 and 2021, the rate of natural forest loss gradually decreased (0.09%/year) instead of fluctuating between different types of land use. The area of forests, perennial crop land, and annual crop land tended to increase from 2000 to 2010; however, from 2010 to 2021, the area of plantation forests decreased markedly, while the area of perennial crop land and annual crop land continued to expand. The analysis of the policies on forest management, exploitation, and protection was applied locally, to explain the causes of the change in spatiotemporal aspects of the types of land-use cover in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. Restoring forest areas during 2010–2021 initially improved effectiveness in forest management and protection. Furthermore, the results provide a better understanding of the current position and role of the government apparatus, cadres, and ethnic minorities in socioeconomic development associated with forest protection and development on the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. The results of this study can help managers monitor annual forest-cover fluctuations based on free remote sensing imagery to reduce both the cost of management and surveying, yielding relatively accurate results.}

Recently, UAVs have focused primarily on applications where human presence is either impossible or hazardous. A swarm of small UAVs can cooperatively complete operations more proficiently and economically than a single large UAV. However, many issues must be resolved before stable and reliable multi-UAV networks can be realized. Task assignment in fleets of UAVs is concerned with cooperative decision-making and control. UAVs possess various functional abilities and kinematic constraints while carrying limited resources onboard. UAVs are nominated to execute multiple sequential tasks supportively on numerous ground targets. The prime objective of task assignment is to minimalize the task accomplishment time and UAV energy consumption. To date, several task assignment algorithms have been designed for UAV networks, and they are comprehensively surveyed in this paper in terms of their main ideas, operational features, advantages, and limitations. These task assignment algorithms are then compared in terms of their significant characteristics and performance factors. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no survey on task assignment techniques for different UAV missions currently exists in the literature. We also discuss open issues and challenges and then suggest projections for task assignment algorithms concerning possible future directions.}

It encompasses several heterogeneous resource and communication standard in ensuring incessant availability of service. At the same time, the development of 6G enables the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in offering cost and time-efficient solution to several applications like healthcare, surveillance, disaster management, etc. In UAV networks, energy efficiency and data collection are considered the major process for high quality network communication. But these procedures are found to be challenging because of maximum mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and energy restricted UAVs. These issues are solved by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and energy efficient clustering techniques for UAVs in the 6G environment. With this inspiration, this work designs an artificial intelligence enabled cooperative cluster-based data collection technique for unmanned aerial vehicles (AECCDC-UAV) in 6G environment. The proposed AECCDC-UAV technique purposes for dividing the UAV network as to different clusters and allocate a cluster head (CH) to each cluster in such a way that the energy consumption (ECM) gets minimized. The presented AECCDC-UAV technique involves a quasi-oppositional shuffled shepherd optimization (QOSSO) algorithm for selecting the CHs and construct clusters. The QOSSO algorithm derives a fitness function involving three input parameters residual energy of UAVs, distance to neighboring UAVs, and degree of UAVs. The performance of the AECCDC-UAV technique is validated in many aspects and the obtained experimental values demonstration promising results over the recent state of art methods.}

We analyse perspectives about 40 policy options to address peatland fires in Indonesia, using a Q methodology approach to rank the options according to perceived effectiveness. Peatland fires in Indonesia are a long-standing and complex social-ecological challenge, where unsolved disagreements about policy options have profound implications for environmental governance, resulting in fires recurring and causing significant CO2 emissions and transboundary haze that affects the health of millions. We collected data from 219 respondents, covering twelve stakeholder categories, including small and large landholders, industrial farmers, scientists, local leaders and government officials. We identified the most representative response from each stakeholder category, and used hierarchical cluster analysis to explore the closeness/distance in perspectives among categories. The results show a particularly noticeable distinction between two broad groups, which we labelled as experts and resource users. Experts tend to prefer solutions that are centralised and largely transformative, whereas resource users favour more localised measures that are more compatible with business-as-usual. We discuss possible reasons for these differences, and their implications for environmental governance, including for how scientists engage in policy.}

abstract = {Of the >6000 species of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae), ~25 species cause significant amounts of tree mortality in conifer-dominated forests. Several tactics are available to manage bark beetle infestations and to reduce associated levels of tree mortality. Suppression involves short-term tactics designed to address current infestations by manipulating beetle populations and typically includes the use of sanitation harvests, insecticides, semiochemicals, or a combination of these and other treatments. Prevention is designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations by manipulating stand, forest, and/or landscape conditions by reducing the number of susceptible hosts through thinning, prescribed burning, and/or altering age classes and species compositions. In this chapter, we review the ecology and management of bark beetles in conifer-dominated forests in North America and Europe, where they exert their largest impacts, and provide six case studies focused on the effects of altered forest and climatic conditions on bark beetle ecology and management. We conclude that in many forests bark beetle outbreaks have and will continue to be exacerbated by climate change due to shifts in temperature and precipitation that influence bark beetles, their hosts, and community associates. Changes in forest structure and composition by natural processes and management practices have and will continue to be important factors as well. As a result, natural resource managers will be increasingly challenged to manage bark beetle populations, and to facilitate recovery of landscapes impacted by bark beetle outbreaks. In most cases, current management tactics are based on research and development executed in the 20th century and unable to meet the demands imposed by altered forest and climatic conditions without some modification and/or adaptation.}

Earth Observations (EO) are an extremely important field which is the source of a huge amount of information and data crucial for the solar energy collection and exploitation. Weather forecast, aerosols, and clouds are three key factors which affect the solar radiance and by extension the amount of power that PV structures are creating. The importance of EO lies in the fact that they provide the evidence necessary for informed decision-making and this is apparent in both the short and longer term. EOs are distinguished into ground-based and satellite-based. Ground-based EO networks are using modern technologies and tools, like pyranometers, pyrgeometer, pyrheliometers, sun photometers, and more, capable of observing solar radiation in different wavelengths. Satellite-based observations refer to the Earth observation satellites, which observe various phenomena that happens on the Earth from space. They are the next step in the environmental data collection process, since they can provide a more comprehensive range of information, covering larger spatial areas from sensors onboard spaceborne satellites which are output as imagery. More than 150 Earth-observation satellites are currently in orbit, carrying sensors that measure different sections of the visible, infrared, and microwave regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Both ground-based and satellite-based EOs are of particular importance to the study of the factors, like weather, aerosols, and clouds, which affect the solar radiance and its related energy conversion structures. For the European Union, the Earth Observation program, which provided all the essential environmental information both from ground-based and satellite-based observation networks, is Copernicus.}

abstract = {The occurrence of forest fires can lead to ecological damage, property loss, and human casualties. Current forest fire smoke detection methods do not sufficiently consider the characteristics of smoke with high transparency and no clear edges and have low detection accuracy, which cannot meet the needs of complex aerial forest fire smoke detection tasks. In this paper, we propose Adjacent layer composite network based on a recursive feature pyramid with deconvolution and dilated convolution and global optimal nonmaximum suppression (ARGNet) for high-accuracy detection of forest fire smoke. First, the Adjacent layer composite network is proposed to enhance the extraction of smoke features with high transparency and no clear edges, and SoftPool in it is used to retain more feature information of smoke. Then, a recursive feature pyramid with deconvolution and dilated convolution (RDDFPN) is proposed to fuse shallow visual features and deep semantic information in the channel dimension to improve the accuracy of long-range aerial smoke detection. Finally, global optimal nonmaximum suppression (GO-NMS) sets the objective function to globally optimize the selection of anchor frames to adapt to the aerial photography of multiple smoke locations in forest fire scenes. The experimental results show that the ARGNet parametric number on the UAV-IoT platform is as low as 53.48 M, mAP reaches 79.03%, mAP50 reaches 90.26%, mAP75 reaches 82.35%, FPS reaches 122.5, and GFLOPs reaches 55.78. Compared with other mainstream methods, it has the advantages of real-time detection and high accuracy.}

abstract = {Natural disasters are often unpredictable and therefore there is a need for quick and effective response to save lives and infrastructure. Hence, this study is aimed at achieving timely, anticipated and effective response throughout the cycle of a disaster, extreme weather and emergency operations management with the help of advanced technologies. This study proposes a novel, evidence-based framework (4-AIDE) that highlights the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based collaborative platforms in disaster, extreme weather and emergency situations. A qualitative approach underpinned by organizational information processing theory (OIPT) is employed to design, develop and conduct semi-structured interviews with 33 respondents having experience in AI and cloud computing industries during emergency and extreme weather situations. For analysing the collected data, axial, open and selective coding is used that further develop themes, propositions and an evidence-based framework. The study findings indicate that AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms offer a structured and logical approach to enable two-way, algorithm-based communication to collect, analyse and design effective management strategies for disaster and extreme weather situations. Managers of public systems or businesses can collect and analyse data to predict possible outcomes and take necessary actions in an extreme weather situation. Communities and societies can be more resilient by transmitting and receiving data to AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms. These actions can also help policymakers identify critical pockets and guide administration for their necessary preparation for unexpected, extreme weather, and emergency events.}

The existence of many UAVs performs difficult process effectually when they are arranged in an adhoc way. The restricted battery capacity of the UAVs, rapid mobility, and high dynamic nature of the UAVs necessities the design of energy efficient clustering and routing protocols. With its motivation, this paper develops an Energy Efficient Neuro-Fuzzy Cluster based Topology Construction with Metaheuristic Route Planning (EENFC-MRP) algorithm for UAVs. The presented model involves EENFC based clustering and MRP based routing processes. The EENFC model make use of three input parameters namely Residual Energy in UAV, Average Distance to Nearby UAVs, and UAV Degree for the cluster construction. In addition, Quantum Ant Lion Optimization (QALO) based MRP is applied to choose an optimal set of routes for intercluster UAV communication. In order to investigate the energy efficient outcome of the EENFC-MRP algorithm, a series of simulation processes were carried out and the results are examined under several aspects. The resultant experimental values ensured the betterment of the EENFC-MRP algorithm over the existing models interms of energy efficiency, throughput, network lifetime, and average delay.}

abstract = {Savannas cover more than 20% of the Earth and account for the third largest stock of global aboveground biomass yet estimates of their above ground biomass density (AGBD) are very inaccurate. The Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) sensor provides near-global full-waveform LiDAR data with 25 m footprints, from which various structural metrics are derived that are used to predict footprint level AGBD. The current GEDI L4A AGBD product uses a comprehensive Forest Structure and Biomass Database (FSBD) to develop models for specific plant functional types and geographic regions, but southern African savannas have been underrepresented in the reference data. The objectives of this study were to (i) validate GEDI L4A AGBD in South African savannas using field measurements and ALS datasets and (ii) develop and evaluate local GEDI footprint-level AGBD estimates from multiple L2A and L2B metrics. The local GEDI AGBD models outperformed GEDI L4A AGBD (R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 12 Mg/ha, %RMSE = 79.5%) with higher R2 and smaller error measures. The local GEDI AGBD using a random forest model (RF) had the highest R2 of 0.71 and lowest %RMSE of 53.3%, while the generalized linear model (GLM) results provided the lowest Relative Mean Systematic Deviation (RMSD) of 9.2%, which was half that of RF model. L4A significantly underestimated AGBD with an RMSD up to −37%. This highlights the importance and benefits of local calibration of biomass models to unlock the full potential of GEDI metrics for estimating AGBD. The field and ALS data have subsequently been contributed to the GEDI FSBD and should be used in calibration of future versions of GEDI L4A AGBD product. This research paves the way for the integration of the local GEDI AGBD estimates with other sensors, notable the eminent NISAR mission, to derive regional to global gridded AGBD products that will enable the monitoring of savanna carbon stocks.}

abstract = {Tundra fires are projected to increase with anthropogenic climate change, yet our ability to assess key wildfire metrics such as fire severity remains limited. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is the most commonly applied index for fire severity mapping. However, the computation of NBR depends on short-wave infrared (SWIR) data, which are not commonly available from historical and contemporary high-resolution (≤4 m) optical imagery. The increasing availability of visible near-infrared (VNIR) measurements from proximal to spaceborne sensors/platforms has the potential to advance our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of fire severity within tundra fires. Here we systematically assess the feasibility of using VNIR data for fire severity mapping in ten Alaskan tundra fires (cumulatively burned ~1700 km2). We compared the accuracy of 10 published VNIR-based fire indices using both uni-temporal (post-fire image) and bi-temporal (pre-fire and post-fire image difference) assessments against ground-based fire severity data (Composite Burn Index, CBI) at 109 tundra sites. The Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) had the highest correspondence with CBI (R2 = 0.77 uni-temporal; R2 = 0.85 bi-temporal), with similar performance to NBR (R2 = 0.77 uni-temporal; R2 = 0.83 bi-temporal). Tundra vegetation types affected NBR but not GEMI, as SWIR reflectance was influenced to a greater extent in shrub than graminoid tundra. We applied GEMI to contemporary high-resolution (i.e. Quickbird 2) and historical meso-resolution imagery (i.e. Landsat Multispectral Scanner) to demonstrate the capability of GEMI for resolving fine-scale patterns of fire severity and extending fire severity archives. Results suggest that GEMI accurately captured the heterogeneous patterns of tundra fire severity across fire seasons, ecoregions, and vegetation types.}

abstract = {Exploitation of the infinitive natural resources is an alarming issue on the plate. Therefore, estimation and swift observation of the natural resources is a need of the hour. Geospatial technological development is playing an important role to collect the information from the targeted objectives. Geospatial technological is helpful to analyze the natural resources viz., land, water, air, energy, nutrients, forest, watershed, etc. for policy and planning toward their conservation in order to achieve food, nutritional, environmental, and economic security. Agriculture is a key sector on the planet for exploitation and interfere the natural resources. For collecting reliable and timely information about the nature, the extent and geographical boundaries, temporal behavior of natural resources is the first step in the way of their monitoring, management and efficient use of them in the agriculture. Remote sensing (RS) has emerged as a powerful geospatial tool for the identification, characterization, and land marking of these resources over a larger surface area in agricultural system. It provides valuable, accurate and timely information in high spatial and spectral resolutions about the agricultural urbanization, crop use patterns, soil, water, watersheds, desertification, agroforestry, rangelands, and climatic variations and their impact on agriculture. In crop production, RS provides the spatial information of crop type and area estimation followed by assessing the yield potential, ecosystem health and proper management of insect-diseases and weeds based on the spectral reflectance of the object by using modeling and vegetative indices. Moreover, RS has a potential to study the soil system like soil characteristics, types, spatial variability, assessment of land suitability, land capability, carbon dynamics, soil moisture, land use/land cover change, soil degradation, erosion identification, and remediation for agriculture applications. RS helps to generate a precise database in short time from the field. Predication for the advance planning, yield estimation of the covering areas, crop sections, drought management help in policymaking for the better production and reduce the risk from the aberrant weather conditions. It helps in proper use and sustainable management of the costly resources in agriculture. This chapter extensively discusses the potential of RS in management of agriculture and natural resources in a sustainable manner. In this context, in India, several programs/projects such as FASAL, CAPE, NNRMS, NADAMS, IMSD, CHAMAN, etc. are effectively running for management of agricultural system in one and another way. In this context, this chapter is useful for the policymaker students, scientists, producers for the agroecosystems management and promote the advance food and environmental security targeted as one of the United National Sustainable Development Goals.}

abstract = {This study assesses the influence of climate change on rainfall and drought in the Benut River Basin (BRB) to support the integrated management of Machap dam. The study seeks to reshape dam safety components in the near future through a technical focus group discussion (FGD) with key stakeholders. Utilizing the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) dataset for the immediate future (2020–2040) under various scenarios (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5), historical Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall datasets (1981 to 2021) are employed. A multi-filtration process ranks twenty-three Global Climate Models (GCMs) using seven relative importance metrics (RIMs). This work's novelty lies in a focused GCM evaluation through individual contributions quantified with RIMs, providing a refined ranking that address the limitations of traditional metrics. Then, the Compromise Programming Index (CPI) aggregates the ranked models, with the top subset selected through Jenks Optimised Classification (JOC), identifying ACCESS-ESM1–5 and CMCC-ESM2 as top models. The selected GCMs were bias-corrected using the linear scaling method and validated before ensembled, effectively replicating the probability distribution function (PDF) of CHIRPS data, as confirmed by a Taylor diagram indicating the closest agreement. The study reveals a generally wetter tendency in the northernmost area of Machap dam under all SSPs, with 5–9 % maximum increasing percentages. Conversely, downstream areas anticipate decreasing rainfall. June (6–22 %) and July (7–22 %) project higher rainfall, indicating increased water availability in a relatively dry period, while December (3–11 %) suggests increasing flood risk. The South West monsoon (SWM) anticipates lower rainfall in early March (3–7 %) and more severe dry periods in August (8–11 %). Future drought occurrences are projected homogeneously across scenarios, with drought months ranging from 15 % to 19 % of the 252 months under all severity classifications. In particular, the study enhances myDAMS by proposing continuous development of the guideline under diverse scenario for Machap dam's overall management and sustainability. Projected scenarios, coupled with outcomes from FGD, can inform basin-scale dam management, aiding risk mitigation for critical dam infrastructure.}

Although post-fire debris flow exhibits time evolution, the key factors controlling its evolution remain unclear. A detailed field investigation, rainfall data collection and remote sensing analysis were conducted to study the debris flow events following the “3.08” forest fire in Xiangjiao gully. The destructive effect of forest fires, the control factors and inherent evolution mechanism of post-fire debris flow were explored. The results highlight that the great disturbance of forest fires to the hydrological response and material source supply conditions promote the outbreak of debris flows. In the rapid response stage of fire, the internal driving force of debris flow evolution is the self-healing of hydrological response characteristics of the basin, including material depletion, particle coarsening and vegetation restoration. In the long-term impact stage, the evolution of debris flows is mainly controlled by factors such as a decrease in root-soil strength caused by root rot, multi-stage gully bank landslide activity, and blockage of woody debris. A conceptual model for the evolution of post-fire debris flows is proposed based on the above evolution characteristic analysis. In particularly, this study emphasizes the catastrophic effect of woody debris during the evolution of post-fire debris flows. The research results provide scientific basis for long-term debris flow risk assessment and mitigation design in recently burnt areas.}

abstract = {The path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formations plays a crucial role in mountainous forest monitoring missions. However, path planning is particularly challenging due to steep terrain and dense vegetation, making it difficult to generate optimal flight paths. The goal of UAV formation path planning in forest monitoring is to create safe, feasible flight paths for each UAV, avoiding terrain obstacles and ensuring coordination and safety, ultimately improving the quality of mission accomplishment. This study establishes a mathematical model that incorporates multiple constraints, such as flight distance, collision threats, and path stability, effectively transforming the complex problem of UAV formation path planning into an optimization problem. To address this multi-constraint path planning optimization problem, an Artificial Rabbit Optimization algorithm incorporating Reinforcement Learning and Thermal conduction search strategy (RLTARO) is proposed. The incorporation of multiple strategies aims to improve the balance of exploration and exploitation of the algorithms as well as algorithmic convergence in the face of complex path planning problems. The comprehensive comparison of the RLTARO algorithm with nine advanced algorithms of similar type in the CEC2017 suite demonstrates its outstanding convergence and robustness across various types of optimization problems. The results of path planning experiments conducted on six mountainous forest terrains with varying complexities demonstrate that RLTARO can efficiently and reliably plan flight paths for UAV formations. Furthermore, the Friedman test results from multiple experiments consistently indicate that RLTARO holds significant performance advantages over the comparison algorithms.}

abstract = {Forests account for nearly 90 % of the world's terrestrial biomass in the form of carbon and they support 80 % of the global biodiversity. To understand the underlying forest dynamics, we need a long-term but also relatively high-frequency, networked monitoring system, as traditionally used in meteorology or hydrology. While there are numerous existing forest monitoring sites, particularly in temperate regions, the resulting data streams are rarely connected and do not provide information promptly, which hampers real-time assessments of forest responses to extreme climate events. The technology to build a better global forest monitoring network now exists. This white paper addresses the key structural components needed to achieve a novel meta-network. We propose to complement - rather than replace or unify - the existing heterogeneous infrastructure with standardized, quality-assured linking methods and interacting data processing centers to create an integrated forest monitoring network. These automated (research topic-dependent) linking methods in atmosphere, biosphere, and pedosphere play a key role in scaling site-specific results and processing them in a timely manner. To ensure broad participation from existing monitoring sites and to establish new sites, these linking methods must be as informative, reliable, affordable, and maintainable as possible, and should be supplemented by near real-time remote sensing data. The proposed novel meta-network will enable the detection of emergent patterns that would not be visible from isolated analyses of individual sites. In addition, the near real-time availability of data will facilitate predictions of current forest conditions (nowcasts), which are urgently needed for research and decision making in the face of rapid climate change. We call for international and interdisciplinary efforts in this direction.}

Recent estimates (since 2010) have reported widely varying mangrove extents from 2000 km² to 3400 km², indicating large uncertainties in current trends. Leveraging five decades of Landsat satellite data, this study offers a methodologically consistent approach to classify Madagascar's mangrove extent, providing a comprehensive dataset from 1972, 1989, 1999, 2009, to 2019. Our findings reveal an overall decrease of 8 % from 2935 km² in 1972–2699 km² in 2019, with loss rates decelerating from 0.4 % per year in the initial period to 0.2 % per year post-1999. This decline primarily reflects anthropogenic pressures, notably in the northern regions. Conversely, the last decade has witnessed a 5 % increase in mangrove coverage, primarily in the central and southern regions, thanks to concerted conservation and reforestation efforts, highlighting a positive shift in mangrove management and protection strategies. This study's long-term perspective is crucial for understanding the dynamics of mangrove coverage and guiding effective intervention strategies in Madagascar.}

Even though end devices are becoming more powerful, the available local resources cannot cope with the requirements of these applications. This has created a new challenge called task offloading, where computation intensive tasks need to be offloaded to more resource powerful remote devices. Naturally, the Cloud Computing is a well-tested infrastructure that can facilitate the task offloading. However, Cloud Computing as a centralized and distant infrastructure creates significant communication delays that cannot satisfy the requirements of the emerging delay-sensitive applications. To this end, the concept of Edge Computing has been proposed, where the Cloud Computing capabilities are repositioned closer to the end devices at the edge of the network. This paper provides a detailed survey of how the Edge and/or Cloud can be combined together to facilitate the task offloading problem. Particular emphasis is given on the mathematical, artificial intelligence and control theory optimization approaches that can be used to satisfy the various objectives, constraints and dynamic conditions of this end-to-end application execution approach. The survey concludes with identifying open challenges and future directions of the problem at hand.}

abstract = {Low-lying Bangladesh is known as one of the most flood-prone countries in the world. During the last few decades, the frequency, intensity, and duration of floods have increased. To ensure safety and save lives when people's homes submerge because of flooding, it is urgent to relocate them to safe shelters during the flooding. In Bangladesh, the number of designated flood shelters is very less. To plan and prioritise the building of shelters, flood hazard zonation and the identification of suitable locations for shelters are vital for disaster risk mitigation. This study attempted the first and most extensive national flood inundation database and flood dynamics of Bangladesh developed between 2017 and 2020 using public domain Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and replicable methodology. Using a set of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) criteria associated with flood disasters (e.g., floods recurrence areas), elevation, land cover, landform, population density, accessibility, distance to road, and distance to settlement layers were used to identify the hazard zones and the safest locations for building flood shelters. The study assessed that 7.11% of the area was inundated by overflow water in June 2017 and 8.99% in August 2017. Similarly, in June, July, and August 2018; June, July and August 2019, and July 2020, with inundation covering 7.26%, 10.87%, 11.07%, 9.50%, 10.56%, 5.01% and 11.14% of the country, respectively. The results show that extremely-high flood prone areas cover about 13% of Bangladesh. Analysis of the suitability of flood shelters shows that about 8% is extremely-high suitable, 16% is very-high suitable, and 7% is very-low suitability for flood shelters. The flood suitability and flood hazard maps would be helpful to support the local government, national and international organisations for flood disaster risk minimisation and the planning and construction of flood shelters.}

abstract = {In recent years, the use of fire as a means by which to manage forest ecosystems has become more frequent in Europe. Fire has a significant impact on the soil, and it is therefore necessary to understand how controlled burns affect this invaluable resource. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the main alterations in the physical-chemical and biological properties of the soil because of a high intensity-controlled burn in “Los Boquerones” area (Villaviciosa de Córdoba, Spain). Additionally, we assessed the spatial heterogeneity of the alterations of different soil properties. A grid of 12 points was established on a hillside in Sierra Morena (Córdoba). Thermocouples were placed at each point, and soil samples were collected at two depths (0–2 cm and 2–5 cm) before burning, immediately after burning and eight months later. Soil pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient content and/or availability, among others, and their spatio-temporal variations were analysed. Soil pH, increased in the first centimetres of the soil (0–2 cm) immediately after burning up to >2 units, and the increase was maintained eight months following the burn. Additionally, the high-intensity burn had a positive short-term effect on some of the soil properties, such as nutrient availability for plants, which was considerably increased. The magnitude of the alterations in the soil indicators assessed was spatially explained by the behaviour of the fire during the controlled burning. The burn also had both direct and indirect effects on soil microorganisms. In conclusion, the possible immediate and short-term effects of burning on the soil resource should be considered for a more holistic management of fire in forest ecosystems, as its functionality and capacity to provide ecosystem services is largely altered by these events as a function of their intensity.}

abstract = {Maximising the spatiotemporal variability of prescribed fire (i.e. pyrodiversity) is often thought to benefit biodiversity. However, given mixed empirical support, the generality of the pyrodiversity hypothesis remains questionable. Here, we use a simulation experiment to explore the effects of spatiotemporal fire patterns on the population trajectories of four mammal species in a northern Australian savanna: northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), northern brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula arnhemensis), grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni), and northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus). Underpinned by data from a landscape-scale fire experiment, we simulated mammal population trajectories under three scenarios of fire size (ambient, small/dispersed fires, large/clumped fires) and three levels of dispersal ability (low, moderate, high) over a 21-year period across the Kapalga area of Kakadu National Park. The simulated population size of all four species declined markedly, regardless of fire spatial pattern and dispersal ability. However, the predicted final population size (i.e. number of individuals in the final timestep of the simulation) for the northern brown bandicoot, northern brushtail possum and grassland melomys were significantly influenced by fire size, with declines most severe under the small/dispersed fire scenario. Our results suggest that maximising the dispersion of small fires at the expense of disturbance refugia (such as less-frequently burnt areas) may exacerbate the severity of mammal decline. This highlights the importance of considering trade-offs between spatial (i.e. fire dispersion) and temporal (i.e. fire frequency) aspects of pyrodiversity, and the potential risks when applying fire management for biodiversity conservation without a firm understanding of the requirements of the target species.}

Perhaps the biggest reason is the ability to tease out important spatial heterogeneity nuances, but also to communicate geographically oriented analysis, planning, management and policy issues in rigorous ways, often as mathematical models, that can be subjected to further scrutiny and evaluation. Further, addressing broad challenges facing emergency response, food production, risk mitigation, transportation, public health, crime, housing and other issues through such approaches has proven an immense benefit to society. This paper focuses on the evolving subfield within regional science of location analysis and modeling, highlighting contributions to date but also detailing exciting areas of advancement involving spatial optimization and geographic information science. The paper includes a reflection on regional science journal publication trends, but also broader patterns of location analytics activity. It is hoped that this review will lead to a reassessment of regional science priorities, and consideration of the role that our specialty areas have in maintaining core strengths as well as potential for growing the discipline in the coming years.}

abstract = {The importance of an optimal solution for disaster evacuation has recently raised attention from researchers across multiple disciplines. This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees’ behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages. This work extends the existing data-oriented framework by outlining comprehensive functionalities and providing seamless integration. We review the principles, challenges, and future direction of the state-of-the-art strategies proposed to sit within each functionality. Taken together, this survey highlights the importance of adaptive coordination and reconfiguration within the fog services to facilitate responsive mass evacuations as well as open up new research challenges associated with analytics-embedding network and computation, which is critical for any disaster recovery activities.}

abstract = {Forest fires may have beneficial effects ecologically, but can also be damaging to the overall health and diversity of flora and fauna and may also result in loss of farm produce and livelihood base of local communities living around the forest reserves. In order to minimize damage from fires to the forest vegetation, information on frequency, timing and control of fire events is needed for decision making at the district and regional management levels of the Forestry Commission. However, not much of such information exists, particularly for northern Ghana. Therefore, this research sought to ascertain occurrences of forest fires and how they are controlled in three (3) Forest Districts in the northern region of Ghana namely: the Tamale, Yendi and Walewale Forest Districts. Respondents comprised staff of Ghana Forestry commission, members of fringe communities and personnel from the Ghana National Fire Service. A mixed method research design involving structured interview schedule, in-depth interviews and quantitative review of secondary data was employed for data collection. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages while qualitative data was analyzed using simple narratives. The study revealed that detection by smoke was the dominant means of detecting fires within the forest reserves. December and January were the months with the most fire occurrences and periods between 2 and 4 h and greater than 8 h were the dominant timeframes within which fires were controlled. Inadequate firefighting equipment and lack of effective cooperation between regulatory institutions and community members were identified as major constraints to effective control of forest fires. Active collaboration between regulatory agencies and members of fringe communities among others are recommended for effective control of wildfires in forest reserves in northern region of Ghana.}

abstract = {Post-bushfire damage assessments show no significant reduction in property damage when compared with past bushfire events. Other than the severity of the attack and the behaviour of the bushfires, the architectural design of the houses, construction materials and, many other factors affect bushfire house ignition. These are generally ignored in the simulations using simplified models. An improved bushfire risk assessment can be conducted if the exact surrounding and the architectural design of the existing houses are considered. However, this is not widely practised due to associated high cost and time, which can be minimised by the adaptation of modern technologies in an efficient way. This study proposes a novel approach to assess the effect of bushfires on individual building structures (houses) in bushfire-prone areas, through heat transfer modelling. It utilises ground and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud to model individual building structures with all their complex features and the surroundings with good dimensional accuracy. These point cloud maps were used to develop heat transfer models by using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to investigate wind velocities, temperature profiles and pressure distributions during bushfires. A case study was conducted for a selected house (elevated building structure) using the proposed approach and the results were compared against a simplified cuboid model of the same house. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying the most vulnerable locations of the building structure compared to the simplified model, which emphasises its applicability in bushfire planning and damage mitigation.}
