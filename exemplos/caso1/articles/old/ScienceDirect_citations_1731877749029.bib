abstract = {Biological invasions are one of the most relevant factors of biodiversity loss, especially after fire disturbances. Wildfires can accelerate invasions of fire-prone species, like Pinus radiata, and dramatically alter ecosystems. However, how to assess the main impacts of this invasion process on the composition, structure, and functionality of ecosystems, including the post-fire revegetation processes, has not been fully resolved. This study aimed to evaluate the impacts of P. radiata invasion on fire-damaged forest ecosystems using combined remote sensing and in situ data, focusing particularly on changes in biodiversity, ecosystem structure, and functionality. The recovery of forest leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) were monitored using Sentinel-2 time series products. Then the pre- and post-fire native community composition and the relationships of invasion and biodiversity with biotic and abiotic components were characterized using structural equation modeling (SEM). The postfire P. radiata density was mapped to quantify invasion intensity in three burned native forest fragments using generalized additive modeling (GAM) regressions based on UAS multispectral data. Biophysical metrics indicate that all forest fragments impacted by high, medium-high, and medium-low severity fires achieved a partial recovery of their canopy. The SEM model showed that microtopographic features and vegetation height explain native species diversity under pre-fire conditions due to their close relationship with favorable microclimatic conditions for species establishment. Vegetation height determined the abundance of P. radiata in post-fire conditions, and it negatively impacted diversity by promoting the homogenization of vegetation cover and altering diversity patterns. The general composition and abundance metrics also showed a substantial modification associated with the heavy (significant) invasion of P. radiata species. Predictive mapping of P. radiata density showed high accuracies (R2 =0.73 and explained deviation of 80%). The maps depicted an intense concentration of the invasive tree with a mean density of 76,217 individuals per ha−1 and high invasion spots with more than 176,000 individuals per ha−1. The quantification of invasion and mapping is a fundamental input for prioritizing areas and resources for a large-scale restoration program, and is a priority to avoid the loss of these highly threatened forest ecosystems.}

abstract = {Airborne microorganisms and biological matter (bioaerosols) play a key role in global biogeochemical cycling, human and crop health trends, and climate patterns. Their presence in the atmosphere is controlled by three main stages: emission, transport, and deposition. Aerial survival rates of bioaerosols are increased through adaptations such as ultra-violet radiation and desiccation resistance or association with particulate matter. Current research into modern concerns such as climate change, global gene transfer, and pathogenicity often neglects to consider atmospheric involvement. This comprehensive review outlines the transpiring of bioaerosols across taxa in the atmosphere, with significant focus on their interactions with environmental elements including abiotic factors (e.g., atmospheric composition, water cycle, and pollution) and events (e.g., dust storms, hurricanes, and wildfires). The aim of this review is to increase understanding and shed light on needed research regarding the interplay between global atmospheric phenomena and the aeromicrobiome. The abundantly documented bacteria and fungi are discussed in context of their cycling and human health impacts. Gaps in knowledge regarding airborne viral community, the challenges and importance of studying their composition, concentrations and survival in the air are addressed, along with understudied plant pathogenic oomycetes, and archaea cycling. Key methodologies in sampling, collection, and processing are described to provide an up-to-date picture of ameliorations in the field. We propose optimization to microbiological methods, commonly used in soil and water analysis, that adjust them to the context of aerobiology, along with other directions towards novel and necessary advancements. This review offers new perspectives into aeromicrobiology and calls for advancements in global-scale bioremediation, insights into ecology, climate change impacts, and pathogenicity transmittance.}

The rate of spread (ROS) of fire, measured using UAV cameras (thermal and visible), was evaluated at 0.45 m/s. The experiment was numerically reproduced using a completely physical 2D model, namely FireStar2D, and the comparison with the experimental measurements mainly concerned the fire ROS and the heat fluxes received by three distant targets placed at the end of the plot. The results analysis shows that the considered fire has a wind-driven regime of propagation with a fire intensity higher than 7 MW/m. The numerical results are in fairly good agreement with the experimental measurements, within 11% difference for the ROS and 5% for the heat fluxes, validating consequently the relevance of the numerical approach to tackle such high-intensity wildfires. Despite the unfavorable wind and humidity conditions for fire propagation (U = 1.67 m/s and RH = 82%), this experiment confirms that such fire can exhibit a dangerous behavior due to the steep slope of the terrain.}

abstract = {Fire severity assessment is crucial for predicting ecosystem response and prioritizing post-fire forest management strategies. Although a variety of remote sensing approaches have been developed, more research is still needed to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of fire severity mapping. This study proposes a unitemporal simulation approach based on the generation of synthetic spectral databases from linear spectral mixing. To fully exploit the potential of these training databases, the Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to build a classifier and regression model. The predictive models parameterized with the synthetic datasets were applied in a case study, the Sierra de Luna wildfire in Spain. Single date Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery of the immediate post-fire environment were used to develop the validation spectral datasets and a Pléiades orthoimage, providing the ground truth data. The four defined severity categories – unburned (UB), partial canopy unburned (PCU), canopy scorched (CS), and canopy consumed (CC) – demonstrated high accuracy in the bootstrapped (about 95%) and real validation sets (about 90%), with a slightly better performance observed when the Sentinel-2A dataset was used. Abundance of four ground covers (green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil, and ash) was also quantified with moderate (~45% for NPV) or high accuracy (higher than 75% for the remaining covers). No specific pattern in the comparison of sensors was observed. Variable importance analysis highlighted the complementary behavior of the spectral bands, although the contrast between the near and shortwave infrared regions stood out above the rest. Comparison of procedures reinforced the usefulness of the approach, as RF image-derived models and the multiple endmember spectral unmixing technique (MESMA) showed lower accuracy. The capabilities for detailed mapping are reflected in the development of different types of cartography (classification maps and fraction cover maps). The approach holds great potential for fire severity assessment, and future research needs to extend the predictive modeling to other burned areas – also in different ecosystems – and analyze its competence and the possible adaptations needed.}

Remote Sensing (RS) can be used to measure a wide range of forest and vegetation parameters that allows for a more detailed and better understanding of their specific influences on housing prices. Herein, through a systematic literature review approach, we reviewed 89 papers (from 2010 to 2022) from 21 different countries that used RS data to quantify vegetation indices, forest and tree parameters of urban forests and estimated their influence on residential property values. The main aim of this study was to understand and provide insights into how urban forests influence residential property values based on RS studies. Although more studies were conducted in developed (n = 55, 61.7%) than developing countries (n = 34, 38.3%), the results indicated for the most part that increasing tree canopy cover on property and neighborhood level, forest size, type, greenness, and proximity to urban forests increased housing prices. RS studies benefited from spatially explicit repetitive data that offer superior efficiency to quantify vegetation, forest, and tree parameters of urban forests over large areas and longer periods compared to studies that used field inventory data. Through this work, we identify and underscore that urban forest benefits outweigh management costs and have a mostly positive influence on housing prices. Thus, we encourage further discussions about prioritizing reforestation and conservation of urban forests during the urban planning of cities and suburbs, which could support UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and urban policy reforms.}

abstract = {Rangelands cover 70% of the world's land surface, and provide critical ecosystem services of primary production, soil carbon storage, and nutrient cycling. These ecosystem services are governed by very fine-scale spatial patterning of soil carbon, nutrients, and plant species at the centimeter-to-meter scales, a phenomenon known as “islands of fertility”. Such fine-scale dynamics are challenging to detect with most satellite and manned airborne platforms. Remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides an alternative option for detecting fine-scale soil nutrient and plant species changes in rangelands tn0020 smaller extents. We demonstrate that a model incorporating the fusion of UAV multispectral and structure-from-motion photogrammetry classifies plant functional types and bare soil cover with an overall accuracy of 95% in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment and disturbed by fire. We further demonstrate that employing UAV hyperspectral and LiDAR fusion greatly improves upon these results by classifying 9 different plant species and soil fertility microsite types (SFMT) with an overall accuracy of 87%. Among them, creosote bush and black grama, the most important native species in the rangeland, have the highest producer's accuracies at 98% and 94%, respectively. The integration of UAV LiDAR-derived plant height differences was critical in these improvements. Finally, we use synthesis of the UAV datasets with ground-based LiDAR surveys and lab characterization of soils to estimate that the burned rangeland potentially lost 1474 kg/ha of C and 113 kg/ha of N owing to soil erosion processes during the first year after a prescribed fire. However, during the second-year post-fire, grass and plant-interspace SFMT functioned as net sinks for sediment and nutrients and gained approximately 175 kg/ha C and 14 kg/ha N, combined. These results provide important site-specific insight that is relevant to the 423 Mha of grasslands and shrublands that are burned globally each year. While fire, and specifically post-fire erosion, can degrade some rangelands, post-fire plant-soil-nutrient dynamics might provide a competitive advantage to grasses in rangelands degraded by shrub encroachment. These novel UAV and ground-based LiDAR remote sensing approaches thus provide important details towards more accurate accounting of the carbon and nutrients in the soil surface of rangelands.}

abstract = {Characterizing the spatial variability of the severity of wildfires is important to assess ecological and economic consequences and to coordinate mitigation strategies. Vegetation indices such as the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) have become a standard tool to assess burn or fire severity across larger areas and are being used operationally. Despite the frequent application of dNBR-like vegetation indices, it is not yet fully understood which variables exactly drive the variability in dNBR observed by multispectral satellites. One reason for this is the lack of high quality prefire information about vegetation structure and composition. Consequently, the influence of prefire vegetation composition and other potentially influential variables such as cast shadows has hardly been examined. Here, we use very high resolution Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) orthoimages collected briefly before and after the large wildfires in Central Chile in the fire season 2016/2017 to derive variables related to the pre- and postfire landscape composition and structure. The variables are used as predictors in Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to explain the spatial variability in dNBR and RdNBR pixel values as observed by Sentinel-2. Our models explain more than 80% and 75% of the variability in dNBR and RdNBR values, respectively, using a sparse set of five predictors. The results suggest that in our study area the largest fraction of variability in Sentinel-2 based dNBR and RdNBR values can be explained by variables related to the fraction of consumed canopy cover while the vegetation composition before the fire does not have a large influence on dNBR and RdNBR. Our results further suggest that cast-shadows of snags and standing dead trees with remaining crown structure have a notable influence on the dNBR signal which may have been underestimated so far. We conclude that spatially continuous, very high spatial resolution data from UAS can be a valuable data source for an improved understanding of the exact meaning of common vegetation index products, operationally used for monitoring the environment.}

Addressing intertwined crises of climate change and biodiversity loss is a pressing global challenge, with trees playing pivotal roles in promoting carbon sequestration and habitat diversity. However, there is a distinct knowledge gap concerning the global drivers shaping tree cover and its heterogeneity, particularly the roles and relative importance of large herbivores and fire compared to climatic and topo-edaphic conditions. Here, we deploy satellite observations of strictly protected areas worldwide to reveal that in regions where vegetation may be in disequilibrium with climate, high biomass of large herbivores, especially browsers, is inversely related to tree cover but positively associated with its spatial heterogeneity. Conversely, fire reduces both tree cover and heterogeneity. These results suggest that top-down megafauna effects on landscape-scale vegetation openness and heterogeneity manifest worldwide. Our finding supports the need to consider megafauna, particularly large herbivores, in ecosystem effects on climate change mitigation and conservation and restoration efforts through trophic rewilding.}

abstract = {Particularly, in automation, industries and environmental monitoring, sensors and electronics technologies are playing a fundamental role in different studies of science and engineering. Sensor’s design and miniaturization have experienced unending change and development together with their use cases’ enlargement. Modern sensor set up, production and calibration have been relatively complicated. Hence, even though sensing devices have considerably enhanced the quality of human lives and they are widely deployed in IoT applications, several safety and risk issues are yet to be resolved. This chapter introduces ubiquitous monitoring of interiors and health via various sensors. There is the writing on technological advances in the fields of radiation, water, and the air. From the sky, it seems the solid-state ubiquitous sensors are considered fundamental elements in all new Intelligent Applications (IA) related to health and safety monitoring. The combination of miniaturization with a set of gamification strategies and machine learning methods for analyzing the large volume of acquired data may help to greatly enhance the effectiveness of a wide-spread implementation. The green miniaturized sensors for analytical and bioanalytical applications development philosophy should consider more about the next world in interior and exterior of the earth.}

However, many organizations still struggle to articulate the necessary AI, and AI experts have difficulties understanding the problems faced by these organizations. This knowledge gap makes it difficult for organizations to identify the technical requirements, such as necessary data and algorithms, for adopting AI. To overcome this problem, we propose a new AI system architecture design methodology based on the IMO (Input-AI Model-Output) structure. The IMO structure enables effective identification of the technical requirements necessary to develop real AI models. While previous research has identified the importance and challenges of technical requirements, such as data and AI algorithms, for AI adoption, there has been little research on methodology to concretize them. Our methodology is composed of three stages: problem definition, system AI solution, and AI technical solution to design the AI technology and requirements that organizations need at a system level. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through a case study, logical comparative analysis with other studies, and experts reviews, which demonstrate that our methodology can support successful AI adoption to organizations.}

abstract = {Major advances continue to be made in development and application of the connectivity concept as a framework for analysis of runoff and sediment fluxes in catchments and landscapes and it is becoming a major paradigm in geomorphology and hydrology. It involves the identification of the locations and patterns of pathways of water and sediment movement and extent of their linkage. However, significant issues and challenges remain. Various approaches to identification and quantification of connectivity in a landscape are taken, involving mapping and modelling of various types. It is important in applying techniques that the purpose and basis is clear. A differentiation is made here between direct mapping of known situations, which elucidates patterns and can then be the basis for quantification, and that of modelling, which is predictive and often explanatory but requires validation. Thus, there is a synergy between the two. Various aspects of the spatial arrangements may be of interest, such as sources of sediment to a point in a catchment, pathway position, hotspots of erosion and deposition, controls on the connectivity, positions of disconnectors, influence of human activities, and natural variability with rainfall, seasons and other factors. The approach and styles of mapping usually entail recording all links at a particular time, possibly with differentiation of type of link, and commonly based on field surveys, but developments are taking place to test the effectiveness of drones for this purpose. Much modelling has used Connectivity Indices to generate patterns, with varying weighting of factors, and additional factors are now being introduced to indices to add functionality to the modelling. The other major approach to modelling is that of graph theory, based on network analysis, which is particularly applied to larger river systems. Both types of modelling have benefitted from availability of open-access software. Deficiencies and problems in use of modelling and indices persist, including: need for validation; ability to recognise disconnections; variability of connectivity over time; distinguishing sediment from flow connectivity; and clarity of representation. Challenges remain of spatial scale, particularly in validation/ field surveys but also base data for modelling; in identifying link status and functioning or dynamics at various timescales, and incorporation of feedback arising from those dynamics; in incorporating processes as a step to this functionality, and in testing indices. Methods and approaches to addressing these challenges are discussed and evaluated here.}

Assessing the risk of drought is closely entangled with the management of earth resources. Droughts can adversely affect the accessibility of water for human consumption and its utilization in diverse economic sectors such as agriculture, industry, and energy production. Thus, the evaluation of drought risk provides crucial information regarding the depletion of groundwater, streamflow conditions, and vulnerability of the water supply. An appropriate understanding, monitoring, and prediction of drought conditions profoundly relies on the characteristics of temperature and precipitation, which must be thoroughly examined for a drought study. Nowadays the utilization of data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in enhancing earth resource management by providing valuable insights, optimizing processes, and aiding decision-making. The present work attempt to document or review various aspects of drought and its vulnerability assessment, followed by a methodology showcasing drought risk assessment with AI, artificial neural network (ANN) model and remote sensing. The stated method will explore the potential occurrence of future droughts under various climate change scenarios. Future precipitation and temperature data can be extracted to estimate future drought indices with ANN method to combine various indices, and to perform trend analysis for comparison of the past, present and future scenarios. This procedure may provide us necessary tools to address extreme weather conditions in a particular area and to prepare for unforeseen circumstances.}

The study of plant functional traits could help the prediction of species responses to disturbances and environmental change, thus providing invaluable knowledge to refine conservation strategies of species and vegetation. However, applications of functional ecology for vegetation management are still underrepresented. The articles in this Special Issue of FLORA offer cutting-edge insights on the variation of plant traits and ecological strategies in response to environmental drivers, such as anthropogenic disturbance, climate and land use change. The results demonstrate how trait-based approaches can be used for the prediction of climate and land use change impacts on vulnerable sets of species or on biogeochemical cycles, reinforcing the concept that functional plant ecology can help identify the most effective procedures for vegetation management, such as the choice of mowing intensity in grasslands or planning vegetation recovery after wildfires. Our knowledge of plant trait coordination at the community level is still undefined, especially concerning the integration of above- and belowground traits. This represents a missed opportunity for vegetation management, especially considering that a complete understanding of the dynamics of the entire ecosystem is crucial for complete understanding of ecosystem properties. Since plant functional traits can represent a straightforward tool for monitoring changes in ecosystem structure and functions, their use could support vegetation monitoring as required by different programs of nature conservation. It would be useful to embrace a perspective that integrates plant traits with systematic conservation planning, ensuring effective and sustainable conservation efforts.}

This study, rooted in human-earth system theory, explores the complex relationships between land use patterns, climate change, and human activities across China from 1996 to 2022. Using a comprehensive analytical framework that combines Geographical Detector (GeoDetector), Random Forest (RF) model, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Spearman's rank correlation, and k-means clustering, we analyzed data from national land surveys, climate records, and nighttime light observations. Our findings indicate a significant, though regionally varied, transformation in land use: arable land decreased by 1.67 %, driven by intense urbanization and policy shifts, particularly in rapidly urbanizing Jiangsu province where arable land diminished by 19.19 %. In contrast, construction land in the northern regions increased by 225.91 million hectares. Climatic influences are apparent, with rising temperatures positively correlating with arable land expansion in the Northeast and Northwest, and urban land in Jiangsu province increasing by 35.51 %. Variations in precipitation patterns were linked to changes in forested areas. This study highlights the dynamic and intricate interactions within the human-earth system, stressing the urgent need for sustainable land management and climate adaptation strategies that improve land use efficiency and resilience. Our research offers a solid foundation for informed policy-making in land management and climate adaptation, advocating a human-earth system science approach to address future environmental and societal challenges.}

Accurate and quantitative monitoring of these emissions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of their impact on the Earth’s climate and for effectively enforcing emission regulations at a large scale. This work examines the feasibility of detecting and quantifying industrial smoke plumes using freely accessible geo-satellite imagery. The existing system has so many lagging factors such as limitations in accuracy, robustness, and efficiency and these factors hinder the effectiveness in supporting timely response to industrial fires. In this work, the utilization of grayscale images is done instead of traditional color images for smoke plume detection. The dataset was trained through a ResNet-50 model for classification and a U-Net model for segmentation. The dataset consists of images gathered by European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite constellation from a selection of industrial sites. The acquired images predominantly capture scenes of industrial locations, some of which exhibit active smoke plume emissions. The performance of the above-mentioned techniques and models is represented by their accuracy and IOU (Intersection-over-Union) metric. The images are first trained on the basic RGB images where their respective classification using the ResNet-50 model results in an accuracy of 94.4% and segmentation using the U-Net Model with an IOU metric of 0.5 and accuracy of 94% which leads to the detection of exact patches where the smoke plume has occurred. This work has trained the classification model on grayscale images achieving a good increase in accuracy of 96.4%.}

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful tool to meet this need, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large, complex models to smaller, more efficient ones without significant loss in performance. This review article provides an extensive examination of KD and its innovative applications in RS. KD, a technique developed to transfer knowledge from a complex, often cumbersome model (teacher) to a more compact and efficient model (student), has seen significant evolution and application across various domains. Initially, we introduce the fundamental concepts and historical progression of KD methods. The advantages of employing KD are highlighted, particularly in terms of model compression, enhanced computational efficiency, and improved performance, which are pivotal for practical deployments in RS scenarios. The article provides a comprehensive taxonomy of KD techniques, where each category is critically analyzed to demonstrate the breadth and depth of the alternative options, and illustrates specific case studies that showcase the practical implementation of KD methods in RS tasks, such as instance segmentation and object detection. Further, the review discusses the challenges and limitations of KD in RS, including practical constraints and prospective future directions, providing a comprehensive overview for researchers and practitioners in the field of RS. Through this organization, the paper not only elucidates the current state of research in KD but also sets the stage for future research opportunities, thereby contributing significantly to both academic research and real-world applications.}

While numerous products are available at kilometer spatial resolutions, there are few global products at high spatial resolutions (10–30 m), which are also referred to fine or medium resolutions in the literature. To facilitate the development of more high spatial resolution products, this paper systematically reviews the state-of-the-art progress on inversion algorithms and publicly available regional and global products. We begin with an inventory of available high-resolution satellite data, and then present different algorithms for determining cloud masks, estimating aerosol optical depth, and performing atmospheric correction and topographic correction for land surface reflectance retrieval. The majority of this paper reviews the inversion algorithms and existing regional to global products of 18 variables in four major categories: 1) Land surface radiation, including broadband albedo, land surface temperature, and all-wave net radiation; 2) Terrestrial ecosystem variables, including leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, fractional vegetation cover, fractional forest cover, tree height, forest above-ground biomass gross primary production, net primary production, and agricultural crop yield; 3) Water cycle and cryosphere, including soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and snow cover; and 4) Land surface types, such as global land cover, impervious surface, inland water, crop type, and fire. Since the existing products over large regions are usually spatially discontinuous due to cloud contamination, different data fusion and data assimilation algorithms and some products for producing spatially seamless and temporally continuous products are presented. In the end, we discuss a variety of challenges in generating global high spatial resolution satellite products.}

Yet ML models often require a substantial amount of ground truth labels for training, and models trained using labeled data from one domain often demonstrate poor performance when directly applied to other domains. Transfer learning (TL) has emerged as a promising strategy to address domain shift and alleviate the need for labeled data. Here we provide the first systematic review of TL studies in environmental remote sensing. We start by defining the different forms of domain shift and then describe five commonly used TL techniques. We then present the results of a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles published between 2017 and 2022, which identified 1676 papers. Applications of TL in remote sensing have increased rapidly, with nearly 10 times more publications in 2022 than in 2017. Across seven categories of applications (land cover mapping, vegetation monitoring, soil property estimation, crop yield prediction, biodiversity monitoring, water resources management, and natural disaster management) we identify several recent successes of TL as well as some remaining research gaps. Finally, we highlight the need to organize benchmark datasets explicitly for TL in remote sensing for model evaluation. We also discuss potential research directions for TL studies in environmental remote sensing, such as realizing scale transfer, improving model interpretability, and leveraging foundation models for remote sensing tasks.}

As cyber–physical systems, ADNs are characterized by widespread structural and functional interdependencies between cyber (communication, computing, and control) and physical (electric power) subsystems and thus present complex hazardous-weather-related resilience issues. To bridge current research gaps, this paper first classifies diverse hazardous weather events for ADNs according to different time spans and degrees of hazard, with model-based and data-driven methods being utilized to characterize weather evolutions. Then, the adverse impacts of hazardous weather on all aspects of ADNs’ sources, physical/cyber networks, and loads are analyzed. This paper further emphasizes the importance of situational awareness and cyber–physical collaboration throughout hazardous weather events, as these enhance the implementation of preventive dispatches, corrective actions, and coordinated restorations. In addition, a generalized quantitative resilience evaluation process is proposed regarding additional considerations about cyber subsystems and cyber–physical connections. Finally, potential hazardous-weather-related resilience challenges for both physical and cyber subsystems are discussed.}

abstract = {Driven by the perception of IoT applications and advanced communication technologies, including beyond 5G and 6G, recent years have seen a paradigm shift from traditional cloud computing towards the local edge of the networks. Modern edge-centric networks have become autonomous and decentralized to expand IoT applications and corresponding data fusion. When edge networks are uncertain, network entities execute tasks locally to increase network performance. Over the past decade, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have been integrated into edge networks to generate optimal decisions and intelligent edge networks. However, complex edge networks with ample state and action space create several challenges in making optimal decisions with the RL technique. To address such shortcomings, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is combined with edge networks to build an intelligent edge framework. Concerning the benefits of edge intelligence, this paper summarizes the importance of traditional and advanced DRL methodologies in edge networks. Besides, we discuss different types of DRL-enabled libraries and state-of-the-art edge models for processing real-time IoT applications. Then, we review other emerging issues in edge networks regarding data offloading, caching, dynamic network access, edge information fusion, and data privacy. Moreover, we incorporate various DRL-enabled IoT applications in edge networks such as healthcare applications, industrial applications, traffic management, etc. Finally, we shed light on future trends of intelligent edge computing regarding system performance, security, and network management.}

We work in cooperation with the City of Austin Fire Department to ensure the accuracy of our forecast and also show that air quality sensor density within our cities cannot validate urban fire presence.

Recently, it has become common to utilize LiDAR (light detection and ranging) canopy metrics to estimate CC over large areas. However, these metrics are primarily related to canopy density rather than the specific definition of CC. Here, two processes that employed individual tree segmentation (ITS) and area-based procedures based on LiDAR data are presented to estimate CC across the Talladega Division of the Talladega National Forest (93,694 ha) at the plot, stand, and landscape levels. The two analytical procedures were assessed using the results of a plot/grid method as a reference dataset, which focused on CC estimates within 255 field measurement fixed-area sample plots. The accuracy of a third process, employing an imagery-based visual CC assessment, was also compared against the two procedures and the reference dataset. The LiDAR-based analytical procedures were able to provide estimates of CC with an RMSE of approximately 15 %, which is acceptable for landscape-level assessments. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that CC maps, when created using LiDAR data, may be suitable for various operational tasks such as assessing the impact of forest disturbances and helping to determine the habitat suitability for certain wildlife species.}

According to reports from the World Health Organization (2019), about 91% of the global population resides in areas affected by poor air quality, which results in poor health conditions, thus causing about 7 million deaths annually and the destruction of the ecosystem. Despite the myriad of proposals to curb these growing concerns caused by air pollutants, air pollution seems to know no bounds because their causatives in terms of the activities that lead to air pollution including manufacturing, incineration, combustion of coal etc. are necessary for human existence and sustenance. Strategic alteration of production patterns and the replacement of conventional heating systems have been proposed as air pollution control measures; however, due to the increased demands posed by basic necessities such as transportation, food, deforestation, and industrial processes, it has become necessary to use smart high-performance data-centric systems/artificial intelligence as air pollution forecasting tools that can examine the sources of these pollutants, predict their prevalence, determine their eventual consequences, as well as proffer informed decisions for contingency actions. In this chapter, topics covered include “deep- and machine-learning applications in air quality modeling, air quality prediction, modeling of particle dispersion/filters, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, industrial air quality control systems concerning data-centric intelligent systems, as well as previous and recent developments and application of these systems in air quality monitoring, assessment, and pollution control.”}

In addition, other crucial factors like site control and the proximity of nearby Russian troops are also considered in developing this suitability model. Human analysts with military knowledge, understanding of standard operating procedure and the strategic importance of a developing battlefield were deployed to identify potential tactical firing locations. The proposed model was developed on Google Earth Engine for ease of distribution and deployment. Four case studies are demonstrated to illustrate the implemented model, interpreted in the context of ongoing conflicts and verified by geospatial intelligence crowdsourced and/or reported by the public and social media.

abstract = {Forest fires are a huge ecological hazard, and smoke is an early characteristic of forest fires. Smoke is present only in a tiny region in images that are captured in the early stages of smoke occurrence or when the smoke is far from the camera. Furthermore, smoke dispersal is uneven, and the background environment is complicated and changing, thereby leading to inconspicuous pixel-based features that complicate smoke detection. In this paper, we propose a detection method called multioriented detection based on a value conversion-attention mechanism module and Mixed-NMS (MVMNet). First, a multioriented detection method is proposed. In contrast to traditional detection techniques, this method includes an angle parameter in the data loading process and calculates the target’s rotation angle using the classification prediction method, which has reference significance for determining the direction of the fire source. Then, to address the issue of inconsistent image input size while preserving more feature information, Softpool-spatial pyramid pooling (Soft-SPP) is proposed. Next, we construct a value conversion-attention mechanism module (VAM) based on the joint weighting strategy in the horizontal and vertical directions, which can specifically extract the colour and texture of the smoke. Ultimately, the DIoU-NMS and Skew-NMS hybrid nonmaximum suppression methods are employed to address the issues of smoke false detection and missed detection. Experiments are conducted using the homemade forest fire multioriented detection dataset, and the results demonstrate that compared to the traditional detection method, our model’s mAP reaches 78.92%, mAP 50 reaches 88.05%, and FPS reaches 122.}

In this framework, measured temperature data are injected into an online heat transfer model, and the real-time temperature at the bottom of the thermal protection system is calculated. A demonstration test system is built and experiments were carried out to validate the method. The effects of dynamic data and the number of sensors on the temperature prediction accuracy are analyzed. Dynamic data-driven temperature predictions under transient heat load are also carried out. The dynamic data-driven model can reduce the temperature prediction error from 25.9% to less than 10% based on the experimental results, and increasing the number of sensors can also improve the prediction accuracy. The model also has good adaptability under accidental overload and cyclic load.

Although many fleet routing protocols have been proposed, only partial inherent constraints of FANET (such as mobility, 3D movement and reliability) are taken into account. Therefore, we propose a new geocast routing protocol namely Geocast routing protocol for fleet of UAVs (GeoUAVs). This protocol aims at delivering information to a specific group of mobile UAVs identified by their geographical location.

LAI estimation through remote sensing data has mostly been investigated using visible and near-infrared (0.4–1.3 μm, VNIR) and Shortwave Infrared (1.4–3 μm, SWIR) data. However, Thermal Infrared (3–14 μm, TIR) data for LAI retrieval has rarely been explored. This study aims to predict LAI by integrating VNIR and TIR data from Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in a mixed temperate forest, the Haagse Bos, Enschede, the Netherlands. The VNIR and TIR images were acquired in September 2020, in conjunction with fieldwork to collect LAI in situ data for 30 plots. TIR images were acquired at two heights (i.e., 85 m and 120 m above ground) to investigate the effect of flight height on the LAI prediction accuracy by means of UAS data. Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) were computed and extracted from the collected images. LAI was estimated using seven vegetation indices and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR). LAI prediction accuracy using VNIR reflectance spectra was compared to the accuracy achieved by integrating VNIR data with LST or LSE applying vegetation indices as well as PLSR. Among the applied vegetation indices, the Reduced Simple Ratio (RSR) gained the highest prediction accuracy using VNIR data (R2 = 0.5815, RMSE = 0.6972); the prediction accuracy was not improved when LST was integrated with VNIR data but increased when LSE was included (RSR: R2 = 0.7458, RMSE = 0.5081). However, when LST from 85 m altitude and VNIR data was applied as an input using PLSR (R2 = 0.5565, RMSECV = 0.7998), the LAI prediction accuracy was slightly increased compared to when only VNIR data was used (R2 = 0.4452, RMSECV = 0.8668). Integrating VNIR data with LSE significantly improved the LAI retrieval accuracy (R2 = 0.7907, RMSECV = 0.8351). These findings corroborate prior research indicating that combining LSE with VNIR data can increase the prediction accuracy of LAI. However, LST was found to be ineffective for this purpose. The relationship between LAI and LSE should be the subject of more investigation through various approachesto bridge the existingscientific gap.}

Therefore, exploration, routine inspections, and surveillance tasks can benefit from using autonomous mobile robots to improve safety by reducing the presence of humans in those scenarios. However, despite advances in the field, there are still challenges to overcome for confined and subterranean robot operation. Real word robotic exploration requires robust and reliable map generation, precise localization, safe navigation, and efficient path planning. These requirements make exploration in complex 3D environments with rugged terrain difficult. The challenge is increased when considering multi-robot teams, as there is no guarantee of a functional network infrastructure. Despite consistent increasing interest in the area, there is a lack of research summarizing the results and best practices for exploring such environments. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a review and discuss state-of-the-art robotic exploration techniques, including single and cooperative approaches with homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, with a focus on complex subterranean and confined 3D scenarios. We also present a comprehensive list of insights on open challenges and possible directions for future investigation in the topic.}

abstract = {Warming induced shifts in tundra vegetation composition and structure, including circumpolar expansion of shrubs, modifies ecosystem structure and functioning with potentially global consequences due to feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate. Satellite-derived vegetation indices indicate widespread greening of the surface, often associated with regional evidence of shrub expansion obtained from long-term ecological monitoring and repeated orthophotos. However, explicitly quantifying shrub expansion across large scales using satellite observations requires characterising the fine-scale mosaic of Arctic vegetation types beyond index-based approaches. Although previous studies have illustrated the potential of estimating fractional cover of various Plant Functional Types (PFTs) from satellite imagery, limited availability of reference data across space and time has constrained deriving fraction cover time series capable of detecting shrub expansion. We applied regression-based unmixing using synthetic training data to build multitemporal machine learning models in order to estimate fractional cover of shrubs and other surface components in the Mackenzie Delta Region for six time intervals between 1984 and 2020. We trained Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal-metrics and synthetic training data generated from pure class spectra obtained directly from the imagery. Independent validation using very-high-resolution imagery suggested that KRR outperforms RFR, estimating shrub cover with a MAE of 10.6% and remaining surface components with MAEs between 3.0 and 11.2%. Canopy-forming shrubs were well modelled across all cover densities, coniferous tree cover tended to be overestimated and differentiating between herbaceous and lichen cover was challenging. Shrub cover expanded by on average + 2.2% per decade for the entire study area and + 4.2% per decade within the low Arctic tundra, while relative changes were strongest in the northernmost regions. In conjunction with shrub expansion, we observed herbaceous plant and lichen cover decline. Our results corroborate the perception of the replacement and homogenisation of Arctic vegetation communities facilitated by the competitive advantage of shrub species under a warming climate. The proposed method allows for multidecadal quantitative estimates of fractional cover at 30 m resolution, initiating new opportunities for mapping past and present fractional cover of tundra PFTs and can help advance our understanding of Arctic shrub expansion within the vast and heterogeneous tundra biome.}

abstract = {The advances in remote sensing sensors during the last two decades have led to the production of very high spatial resolution multispectral images. In order to adapt to this rapid development and handle these data, object-based analysis has emerged. A critical part of such an analysis is image segmentation. The selection of optimal segmentation parameters' values generates a qualitative segmentation output and has a direct impact on feature extraction and subsequent overall classification accuracy. Even though several image segmentation methods have been developed and suggested in the literature, each of them has advantages and disadvantages. This article presents the conceptual characteristics of image segmentation methods with a special focus on semantic segmentation. In addition, a meta-analysis was conducted through a comprehensive review of recent image segmentation case studies. It includes statistics and quantitative data regarding the applied segmentation algorithm, the software utilized and the data source among others. Since there is no miraculous segmentation algorithm, the statistical results depict only the recent trend. Finally, a few interesting subjects are addressed, including identification of current problems, image segmentation on non-traditional data and hot topics for future research.}

abstract = {Land degradation is a major environmental and social issue in temperate steppes. It is commonly determined from vegetation cover using remote sensing techniques. Steppes in eastern Mongolia are subject to resource extraction activities, such as mining and oil extraction, which affect land degradation. Recent technological progress in remote sensing has facilitated the acquirement of high-resolution data by, for example, the CubeSat satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), providing data for detailed maps of vegetation cover and plant functional groups (PFGs). Traditional methods for monitoring vegetation cover often face typical scale issues, such as the upscaling of vegetation parameters if plot-scale field measurements are integrated to satellite data. Here, we studied the spatial distribution of PFG using machine learning and a combination of field measurements, UAV imagery (spatial resolution: 2 cm), and PlanetScope multi-temporal imagery. We provide two products at two spatial resolutions: one for UAV data, which is restricted to comparatively small areas around field measurements, and one for PlanetScope, which covers large parts of northeastern Mongolia. The results showed that the overall accuracies of UAV classification were 91–95%, whereas those of PlanetScope were 78–95%. In integrating the classified UAV data to the PlaneScope data, our proposed model minimized the scale issue that often impedes classification. Importantly, our findings revealed that the ecological effects of dirt road and railroad extended up to 60–120 m into the adjacent, otherwise less degraded steppe vegetation. A comparison between burned and unburned areas in different years indicates that wildfires affect the composition of PFG in reducing the fractional cover of graminoids and forbs, and that increasing cover of bare ground leads to a distinct and patchy mosaic of different vegetation types.}

abstract = {In a world grappling with a growing population and shifting climate patterns, ensuring safe and sustainable food production has emerged as a paramount challenge. Extreme climate events, such as late spring frosts (LSFs), have a detrimental impact on productivity, plant growth, and consequently, crop yield. Similarly, viticulture is intricately linked to weather and climate conditions. Frost risk can be a significant issue in viticulture, potentially causing major economic damages with yield losses affecting vast areas or even entire territories from a single event. Chilling temperatures (ranging from 0 to 15 °C) and freezing conditions (below 0 °C) present unique challenges for vineyards, occurring when temperatures deviate from their usual range. These temperature fluctuations can significantly impair viticulture, affecting grapevines and diminishing both the quality and quantity of the grape harvest. In recent years, frost events have become more frequent and severe while winegrowers use various techniques to combat frost. This article aims to summarize the negative effects of extreme frost conditions in a changing climate on grapes and wine production and provide novel solutions and adaptation strategies, including sensing analysis tools, to help vineyards mitigate these impacts and ensure sustainable production.}

In large landscapes, these limited methods may not capture the spatial and temporal variation of floral resources. Recent advances in sensors and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms offer opportunities to characterize the dynamic distribution of floral resources at the landscape level. In this study, UAV imagery and a multistep machine learning classification analysis were used to quantify floral resources in nonagricultural environments, where topography, vegetation, and inflorescence size were variable. Seven flowering species covering an area of 2 138 m2 were classified throughout our study, equaling 0.5% of the overall landscape. We determined the period of flowering for important species based on the temporal changes of the floral area classified from UAV images. Models performed well considering the extreme rarity of flowers in the UAV images. The flower class in the land cover classification models performed well with an average sensitivity of 0.77 and average specificity of 0.99. Individual flower classes also performed well with the majority of flower classes receiving sensitivity and specificity values of over 0.90. The use of UAVs is a feasible method for characterizing floral resources in nonagricultural settings. Classifications would benefit from a more robust and comprehensive UAV and floral resource sampling plan, to better characterize the variability of floral resources in UAV imagery.}

abstract = {A significant growth in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) operations has been observed over the past decade, largely driven by the emergence of new commercial opportunities and use-cases. This has posed new technological and regulatory challenges in order to address the complex safety, efficiency and sustainability requirements associated with UAS operations in an increasingly congested airspace. The growing need for trusted autonomy in UAS operations imposes demanding performance requirements on Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS), both in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. In most current NGS implementations, system autonomy is tightly constrained within a specified set of operational and environmental conditions through a large number of explicit rules. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods and the emergence of highly-parallelized processor boards with low form-factor has led to the opportunity to employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques to enhance navigation system performance, particularly for small UAS (sUAS), which account for the majority of current and future unmanned aircraft use-cases. sUAS navigation systems typically employ diverse low Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) sensors such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, MEMS-IMUs, magnetometers, cameras and Lidars for localization, obstacle detection and avoidance. This paper presents a comprehensive review of conventional sUAS navigation systems, including aspects such as system architecture, sensing modalities and data-fusion algorithms. Additionally, performance monitoring and augmentation strategies are critically reviewed and assessed against current and future UAS Traffic Management (UTM) requirements. The primary focus is on the identification of key gaps in the literature where the use of AI-based methods can potentially enhance navigation performance. A critical review of AI-based methods and their application to sUAS navigation is conducted, along with an assessment of the performance benefits they provide over conventional navigation systems. Reviewed methods include but are not restricted to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) such as Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNN and RNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble techniques. The key challenges associated with adapting these methods to address sUAS operational objectives are clearly identified. The review also covers the assurance of predictable, deterministic system behaviour which is a key requirement to support system certification. The review and analysis will inform the reader of the applicability of various AI/ML methods to sUAS navigation and autonomous system integrity monitoring, and its likely role in the ongoing UTM evolution.}

Climate change alters annual fire frequency, with increased intensity, lengthening the fire season and the area burned. More frequent extreme weather and drought increase the danger of severe wildfire seasons and mega-fires. A warming climate accelerates insect development and survival, expanding the true or outbreak range of species in boreal and temperate forests as evidenced by recent outbreaks of bark beetles and defoliators. Relative SLR increases the frequency and severity of coastal flooding and erosion and accelerates saltwater intrusion; extreme high tides that occurred once per century are projected to occur at least annually by 2100.}

The approach employed here utilizes Behavioral Cloning, a technique in which human pilots supply a series of sample maneuvers. These maneuvers serve as training data for a Machine Learning algorithm, enabling the system to generate control models for each maneuver. The optimal instances for each maneuver were chosen based on a set of objective evaluation criteria. By utilizing these selected sets of examples, resilient models were developed, capable of reproducing the maneuvers performed by the human pilots who supplied the examples. In certain instances, these models even exhibited superior performance compared to the pilots themselves, a phenomenon referred to as the “clean-up effect”. We also explore the application of transfer learning to adapt the developed controllers to various airplane models, revealing compelling evidence that transfer learning is effective for refining them for targeted aircraft. A comprehensive set of intricate maneuvers was executed through a meta-controller capable of orchestrating the fundamental maneuvers acquired through imitation. This undertaking yielded promising outcomes, demonstrating the proficiency of several Machine Learning models in successfully executing highly intricate aircraft maneuvers.

With layers of said protocols functioning as ”black boxes”, any form of interaction between non-adjacent layers constitutes a direct violation of the protocols’ architecture. The work presented in this survey intends to examine existing protocols of both legacy and cross-layer architectures in terms of their potential in accommodating routing in FANET deployments. Special attention is given to multi-altitude (3D) deployments, where a substantially greater amount of processing and packet route complexity is observed, and a greater amount of node location precision is required. The potential of cross-layer designs is expressed as a function of power budgeting, mobility (and awareness thereof), security, and resource allocation, given their importance for efficient control of flying ad hoc networks.}

The three disaster time periods of pre-, during, and postdisaster help organize the contribution of smart technologies in the disaster management cycle, but each time period has its own data needs, data processing, smart technology requirements, and applications of data. This chapter also explores human behavior during the three disaster periods with changes in human mobility as an important aspect of human behavior during disasters. Urban form includes a multitude of characteristics that may be impacting disaster management but when we consider human mobility, evacuation exits and assembly areas become important aspects to consider, as they are affected by urban form.

We aimed to test the usefulness of ecological niche models (ENMs) to integrate the effects of climate change on tree species distributions into post-fire restoration planning. We also examined different important conceptual and methodological aspects during this novel process. We constructed ENM at fine spatial resolution (25 m) for the four main tree species (Pinus pinaster, Quercus pyrenaica, Q. faginea and Q. ilex) in an area affected by a megafire in Central Spain at two scales (local and regional), two periods (2 and 14 years after the fire) at the local scale, and under two future climate change scenarios. The usefulness of ENMs as support tools in decision-making for post-fire management was confirmed for the first time. As hypothesized, models developed at both scales are different, since they represent different scale dependent drivers of species distribution patterns. However, both provide objective information to be considered by stakeholders in combination with other sources of information. Local models generated with vegetation data 14 years after the fire provided valuable information about local and current vegetation dynamics (i.e., current microecology spatial niche prediction). Regional models are capable of considering a higher proportion of the climatic niche of species to generate reliable climate change forecasts (i.e., future macroclimate spatial niche forecast). The use of precise ENMs provide both an objective interpretation of potential habitat conditions and the opportunity of examining vegetation patches, that can be very valuable in managing restoration of areas affected by megafires under climate change conditions.}

Since existing methods for automatic fault diagnosis require expensive sensors, they are only cost-effective for large-scale systems. To address these drawbacks, we propose a fault diagnosis model based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which monitors a group of PV systems by comparing their current and voltage production over the last 24h. This methodology allows for monitoring PV systems without sensors, as hourly measurements of the produced current and voltage are obtained via the PV systems’ inverters. Comprehensive experiments are conducted by simulating 6 different PV systems in Colorado using 6 years of real weather measurements. Despite large variations in number of modules, module type, orientation, location, etc., the GNN can accurately detect and identify early occurrences of 6 common faults. Specifically, the GNN reaches 84.6%±2.1% accuracy without weather data and 87.5%±1.6% when satellite weather estimates are provided, significantly outperforming two state-of-the-art PV fault diagnosis models. Moreover, the results suggest that GNN can generalize to PV systems it was not trained on and retains high accuracy when multiple PV systems are simultaneously affected by faults.}

This review highlights the most promising technologies and strategies in remediation emphasizing their potential to protect ecosystems and human health. In soil remediation, phytoremediation utilizes plants to absorb and immobilize pollutants while bioremediation employs microorganisms to degrade organic contaminants in a sustainable manner. Nanotechnology offers innovative solutions through the use of nanoparticles as efficient sorbents or catalysts. For water remediation, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as photocatalysis and ozonation effectively degrade recalcitrant pollutants enhancing water quality. Biochar and other sorbents present viable options for pollutant removal and membrane technologies like reverse osmosis provide selective purification for diverse applications. The review underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration in advancing remediation technologies. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning can further optimize these processes by analyzing complex data and predicting pollutant behavior.

While existing literature offers various frameworks, they primarily focus on traditional building maintenance procedures and overlook the importance of integrating sustainability, climate change, environmental factors, and emerging technologies. To address this gap, this research has developed a comprehensive framework that caters to current needs, challenges, and future priorities. The integrated framework for building maintenance operations aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate change mitigation and adaptation, the adoption of emerging technology, energy conservation, as well as safety, resilience, and effectiveness. The development of the framework encompassed four phases: pre-development phases 1 and 2, development phase 3, and validation phase 4. During this process, current issues and challenges were identified, impacts were assessed, and strategies were developed. The framework serves as a roadmap to address these challenges and requirements in future building maintenance operations, making significant contributions to all three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. In summary, this study offers a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the current issues, challenges, and potential improvements and benefits in building maintenance operations, providing a practical guide for industry stakeholders and making a significant contribution to the existing body of knowledge.}

abstract = {Drought is a costly natural disaster characterized by water shortages that impact water availability, agriculture, ecosystems, and the economy. The driving mechanisms of drought operate on a wide range of spatial scales, from the movement of soil water on a hillslope to global atmospheric circulation. Additionally, drought impacts vary across spatial scales, from drought induced crop stress on a specific agricultural field to widespread continental water shortages. As a result, multiscalar drought monitoring and early warning systems are needed to utilize observational data sets obtained at different spatial scales and to communicate drought impacts to various levels of decision-makers in government and industry. However, scaling must be employed to translate information across scales, either to fix incongruencies in the spatial scale of input data sets or to modify the model output scale. These scaling techniques have several challenges and limitations that hinder drought accuracy and interpretability, such as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and increased model uncertainty. This paper reviews the role of spatial scale in drought monitoring and early warning systems, the associated challenges, and techniques to minimize their impact. Finally, this review identifies several knowledge gaps and future directions.
La sécheresse est une catastrophe naturelle coûteuse caractérisée par des pénuries d’eau qui ont un impact sur la disponibilité de l’eau, l’agriculture, les écosystèmes et l’économie. Les mécanismes moteurs de la sécheresse opèrent sur un large spectre d’échelles spatiales, allant du mouvement de l’eau du sol sur une pente de colline à la circulation atmosphérique globale. De plus, les impacts de la sécheresse varient selon les échelles spatiales, allant du stress des cultures induit par la sécheresse dans un champ agricole spécifique aux pénuries d’eau généralisées à l’échelle du continent. Par conséquent, des systèmes de surveillance de la sécheresse et d’alerte précoce multi-scalaires sont nécessaires pour utiliser les ensembles de données d’observation obtenus à différentes échelles spatiales et pour communiquer les impacts de la sécheresse à différents niveaux de décideurs au gouvernement et dans l’industrie. Cependant, la mise à l’échelle doit être utilisée pour traduire l’information à travers les échelles, soit pour corriger les incongruités dans l’échelle spatiale des ensembles de données d’entrée, soit pour modifier l’échelle de sortie du modèle. Ces techniques de mise à l’échelle présentent plusieurs défis et limites qui nuisent à la précision et au potentiel d’interprétation de la sécheresse, comme le problème d’agrégation spatiale (MAUP ; Modifiable Areal Unit Problem) et l’incertitude accrue du modèle. Cet article examine le rôle de l’échelle spatiale dans la surveillance de la sécheresse et les systèmes d’alerte précoce, les défis associés, et les techniques pour minimiser leur impact. Enfin, cette synthèse identifie plusieurs lacunes dans les connaissances et les orientations futures. [Traduit par la Rédaction]}

Artificial intelligence applications to facilitate foodborne illness outbreak investigations, development of HACCP plans, and food safety root cause analyses at the retail level are needed. For example, the interview form in the International Association for Food Protection booklet, Procedures to Investigate Foodborne Illness, could be filled out by humans, but much of the rest of the forms could be completed by artificial intelligence applications. Humans would still have to do the environmental assessments. Most AI applications to date have consisted of pattern identification. Pattern recognition applications may not be capable of assisting in all the proposed retail applications, but it would not be helpful to propose these retail applications without offering a possible path forward. Progress in the proposed directions may require the development of more robust artificial intelligence based on cognitive models. Because this paradigm shift is less familiar to food safety professionals, a comparison between pattern recognition algorithms and cognitive models is offered. An explanation of cognitive models is included to raise awareness of this approach.}

Manufacturers are constantly looking for methods to lower the operating expenses associated with production processes. Manufacturers might optimise their value chain's production and associated processes by adopting sustainability 4.0 technologies. Such technologies will help manufacturers select their optimal facilities and employees, lower operational costs, enhance productivity and resource utilisation and provide a picture of process gaps that can be addressed. Sustainability is based on the effective use and reuse of resources across the product life cycle, from materials and processes to equipment and skills. Sustainable manufacturing produces manufactured goods using economically viable procedures that reduce negative environmental consequences while preserving energy and natural resources. This paper briefs Sustainability 4.0 and its significant needs. Various fundamental technologies and futuristic research aspects for Sustainability 4.0 are discussed diagrammatically. Finally, we identified and discussed significant applications of Sustainability 4.0 in manufacturing. Sustainability 4.0 refers to a long-term vision for enterprises that allows them to continue perpetually without depleting resources faster than they can be replaced.

Estimation of PM2.5 using satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products is a popular method. In this paper, we review the PM2.5 estimation process based on satellite AOD data in terms of data sources (i.e., inversion algorithms, data sets, and interpolation methods), estimation models (i.e., statistical regression, chemical transport models, machine learning, and combinatorial analysis), and modeling validation (i.e., four types of cross-validation (CV) methods). We found that the accuracy of time-based CV is lower than others. We found significant differences in modeling accuracy between different seasons (p < 0.01) and different spatial resolutions (p < 0.01). We explain these phenomena in this article. Finally, we summarize the research process, present challenges, and future directions in this field. We opine that low-cost mobile devices combined with transfer learning or hybrid modeling offer research opportunities in areas with limited PM2.5 monitoring stations and historical PM2.5 estimation. These methods can be a good choice for air pollution estimation in developing countries. The purpose of this study is to provide a basic framework for future researchers to conduct relevant research, enabling them to understand current research progress and future research directions.}

abstract = {Over the period, two significant advancements i.e. shrinking of the sensor size and improved communication capability, lead the sensor-based internet-of-things (SBIoT) to mature rapidly. SBIoT has various applications to make human life smarter such as health care IoT, smart cities, agriculture, automated industries, security etc. The sensor collects data by monitoring a natural phenomenon from the environment and the internet is used to communicate that to the end-user. Much research has been done to detect events in such environments. The present work surveys diverse methodologies designed to capture the events of interest from collected data in different application domains of SBIoT. This paper revisits the understanding of detecting events of interest using SBIoT framework and discusses the detailed requirements for event detection. Further, different types of events have been identified, discussed and categorization is made. The authors observed the need to put the different categories of event detection in one paper so that researchers can get idea about state of art of the domain. Previously published surveys focused on a specific domain of event detection such as Health IoT, security in SBIoT, agriculture IoT etc. Further such works defined the occurrences in the deployed field as events of interest in very narrow terms. Thus in most of the existing surveys, the event definition is mostly domain-specific and the focus is on the application area rather than techniques of event detection. Thus, there existed a gap for a holistic survey that conceptualizes different application domains into atomic categories and integrates different techniques available for SBIoT using a common thread of event detection. Hence, the event-based monitoring frameworks in SBIoT are segregated and diversified Event detection models are discussed based on the application domains. The paper describes event detection challenges and methodologies in different domains i.e rule-based, probability and statistics based, multimedia-based, intelligent system based and signal processing based methodologies. Further, the comparative analysis of various recently proposed methods has been carried out in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. The present work also discusses the existing research gaps in the domain of event detection and the authors believe that it will be helpful for researchers in academia and industry to develop new methodologies.}

abstract = {Small satellites enable many important applications for both economic and scientific purposes. Many of these applications are inherently data-centric and rely on large amounts of high-resolution satellite imagery to be delivered in a timely manner. However, communicating this data to Earth is challenging due to intermittent connectivity, high packet losses, low data rates, and similar issues. Therefore, efficient onboard prioritization and data processing are essential for future satellite missions. Machine learning methods, such as deep neural networks, are very suitable for such prioritization, as they are already used extensively for satellite imagery processing and they can be deployed onboard of satellites. However, updating them to support new classification requirements when the satellite is already in orbit is difficult, as often multiple passes are required to complete model transmission due to the communication challenges. To cope with this issue, we propose a progressive transmission mechanism for model updates, which leverages vector quantization and arithmetic coding. Our mechanism allows to achieve high accuracies even with partially updated models. Evaluation results show that our mechanism significantly outperforms other less optimized transmission schemes.}

abstract = {Arctic vegetation communities are rapidly changing with climate warming, which impacts wildlife, carbon cycling, and climate feedbacks. Accurately monitoring vegetation change is thus crucial, but scale mismatches between field and satellite-based monitoring cause challenges. Remote sensing from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a bridge between field data and satellite-based mapping. We assessed the viability of using high-resolution UAV imagery and UAV-derived Structure from Motion to predict cover, height, and aboveground biomass (henceforth biomass) of Arctic plant functional types (PFTs) across a range of vegetation community types. We classified imagery by PFT, estimated cover and height, and modeled biomass from UAV-derived volume estimates. Predicted values were compared to field estimates to assess results. Cover was estimated with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 6.29%–14.2%, and height was estimated with an RMSE of 3.29–10.5 cm depending on the PFT. Total aboveground biomass was predicted with an RMSE of 220.5 g m−2, and per-PFT RMSE ranged from 17.14 to 164.3 g m−2. Deciduous and evergreen shrub biomass was predicted most accurately, followed by lichen, graminoid, and forb biomass. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of using UAVs to map PFT biomass, which provides a link towards improved mapping of PFTs across large areas using earth observation satellite imagery.
Les communautés végétales de l’Arctique changent rapidement avec le réchauffement climatique, ce qui influence la faune, le cycle du carbone et les rétroactions climatiques. Il est donc crucial de surveiller avec précision les changements de la végétation, mais les disparités d’échelle entre la surveillance sur le terrain et la surveillance par satellite posent des défis. La télédétection à partir de véhicules aériens sans pilote (UAV) est apparue comme un pont entre les données de terrain et la cartographie par satellite. Les auteurs évaluent la viabilité de l’utilisation de l’imagerie haute résolution par des UAV et de la structure acquise à partir du mouvement (SfM – Structure from Motion) d’UAV pour prédire la couverture, la hauteur et la biomasse hors-sol (ci-après biomasse) de types fonctionnels de plantes (PFT — Plant functional types) de l’Arctique dans une gamme de types de communautés végétales. Ils ont classé l’imagerie par PFT, estimé la couverture et la hauteur, et modélisé la biomasse à partir des estimations de volume obtenues par UAV. Les valeurs prédites ont été comparées aux estimations sur le terrain pour évaluer les résultats. La couverture a été estimée avec écart moyen quadratique (EMQ) de 6,29-14,2 % et la hauteur a été estimée avec un EMQ de 3,29-10,5 cm, selon le PFT. La biomasse hors-sol totale a été prédite avec un EQM de 220,5 g m-2, et l’EQM par PFT variait de 17,14 à 164,3 g m-2. La biomasse des arbustes à feuilles caduques et à feuilles persistantes a été prédite avec le plus de précision, suivie par la biomasse des lichens, des graminoïdes et des herbes non graminéennes. Ces résultats démontrent l’efficacité de l’utilisation d’UAV pour cartographier la biomasse de PFT, ce qui établit un lien vers cartographie améliorée des PFT sur de grandes superficies grâce à l’imagerie satellitaire d’observation de la terre.

abstract = {The area burned in Spain exceeded historical records in 2022, when exceptionally warm conditions influenced wildfire events. The predicted intensification of wildfire regimes includes an increase in frequency, severity, and size. Therefore, a study of the wildfires that occurred in 2022 is necessary to understand their behaviour and possible environmental impacts. The objective of this study is to analyse the applicability of using spectral indices and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches to map the spatial distribution and estimate potential soil losses using Sentinel-2 imagery and fire severity field data. Soil losses were estimated using an empirical model based on soil burn severity data collected in the field after wildfire. The relationship between the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), Difference Normalized Wildfire Ash Index (dNWAI), and the Blue Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (BNDVI) with the estimated soil losses was then evaluated. In addition, the influence of different time scales of the satellite images was analysed. The first period considered (Date I) ranges from 8 to 20 days after the beginning of the wildfire, which coincides with the field data collection. The second period considered (Date II) ranges from 28 to 35 days after the start of the wildfire. The results obtained showed a significant dependence relationship between the BNDVI index (using satellite images of Date I) and the estimated soil losses (R2 = 0.756), while the results of the NDII (R2 = 0.31) and dNWAI (R2 = 0.061), showed no spatial relationship with the estimated soil losses. Three of the largest wildfires in 2022 in Spain were analysed, and the results showed strong correlations of BNDVI index for Folgoso do Courel (R2 = 0.808), for Carballeda de Valedorras (R2 = 0.906), and for Sierra de la Culebra (R2 = 0.939). In addition, these results allowed the mapping and quantification of potential soil losses in areas where fire severity was high, totalling ∼2,50,000 Mg ha−1 in Folgoso do Courel, ∼3,70,000 Mg ha−1 in Carballeda de Valdeorras, and ∼4,70,000 Mg ha−1 in Sierra de la Culebra. Moreover, BNDVI values for estimating soil loss vary by vegetation type, and there is a positive correlation between severity classes and the BNDVI index. This approach can inform post-fire land management decisions in future wildfires and could be applied to other regions.}

For now, issues such as data accessibility and shortages of AI talent constrain its application for social good. This chapter has grouped use cases into 10 social-impact domains based on taxonomies in use among social-sector organizations. Each use case highlights a type of meaningful problem that can be solved by one or more AI capability. The cost of human suffering, and the value of alleviating it, are impossible to gauge and compare. Nonetheless, employing usage frequency as a proxy, we measure the potential impact of different AI capabilities.}

This study analyzed the viability of using nadir or downward photos from smartphones (iPhone 7) to provide quantitative ground cover and biomass loading estimates. Good correlations were found between field measured values and pixel counts from manually segmented photos delineating a pre-defined set of 10 discrete cover types. Although promising, segmenting photos manually was labor intensive and therefore costly. We explored the viability of using a trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to perform image segmentation automatically. The DCNN was able to segment nadir images with 95% accuracy when compared with manually delineated photos. To validate the flexibility and robustness of the automated image segmentation algorithm, we applied it to an independent dataset of nadir photographs captured at a different study site with similar surface vegetation characteristics to the training site with promising results.}

This paper presents a multidisciplinary analysis of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Along with the latest observations and simulation studies, we synthesize the time-series and event progressions during the accident across multiple disciplines, including in-plant physics and engineering systems, operators’ actions, emergency responses, meteorology, radionuclide release and transport, land contamination, and health impacts. We identify three key factors that exacerbated the consequences of the accident: (1) the failure of Unit 2 containment venting, (2) the insufficient integration of radiation measurements and meteorology data in the evacuation strategy, and (3) the limited risk assessment and emergency preparedness. We conclude with new research and development directions to improve the resilience of nuclear energy systems and communities, including (1) meteorology-informed proactive venting, (2) machine learning-enabled adaptive evacuation zones, and (3) comprehensive risk-informed emergency planning while leveraging the experience from responses to other disasters.}

abstract = {Surface ozone (O3) is a harmful air pollutant that is created through complex atmospheric photochemical reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOx) and various precursors. Its abundance depends on the associated chemical pathways, local environmental conditions, and meteorological factors, the latter of which affects the dispersal of O3. This research investigates vertical and horizontal variations in NO2 and O3 in urban and rural areas associated with atmospheric parameters at 13 monitoring locations stretching from greater Bangkok to Ratchaburi Province, Thailand. O3 and NO2 were measured concurrently with temperature and relative humidity using calibrated portable devices (Aeroqual, Series 500), typically at heights of 1.5, 75, and 110 m. The instruments were mounted on a drone to obtain measurements at elevations of 75 m and 110 m. The data obtained showed that even in the lowest part of the boundary layer, the average concentrations of O3 in the urban area increased by nearly 21% with altitude from the ground (26.8 ± 4.7 ppb at 1.5 m) to 110 m. However, in the rural area, the average ground concentrations of O3 were higher (38.6 ± 11.8 ppb) but they decreased by approximately 43% at 110 m. Notably, at all monitoring sites, NO2 concentrations exhibited a decreasing trend with height above the ground. As the wind conditions were stagnant, the ground measurements at each station were representative of local conditions. However, modelling of air mass backward trajectories indicated that despite the stagnant conditions at the ground level, there were contributions from long-range transport (even within the shallow atmospheric layers) at elevations as low as 110 m above the ground.}

This research aims to improve these vehicles' ability to identify pollution sources and develop strategies, with a focus on transportation-related pollution. Detailed air pollution tests revealed that pollutant concentrations surged during morning rush hours, especially in high-traffic coastal areas, while areas away from traffic had much lower levels. Evening tests showed that pollutants from daytime traffic had dispersed throughout the urban area. The consistent northward shift in pollutant concentrations underscored the link between traffic patterns and pollutant distribution. Quantitative analyses and the resulting air pollutant maps showed average increases in pollutant concentrations between morning and evening hours in high-traffic areas: 12.1% for NO2, 5.3% for CO, 9.8% for PM10, and 11.4% for PM2.5. In contrast, the increases in pollutant concentrations in less trafficked urban regions were 45.9%, 48.2%, 32.7%, and 29.5%, respectively. This demonstrates how air pollution originating from areas with heavy traffic impacts other regions through environmental and geographical factors. The findings underscore the need for comprehensive air quality management strategies at the city level, targeting emissions in high-traffic areas and adapting to temporal fluctuations in pollutant levels.}

abstract = {“Natural disasters threaten human life, Earth's ecosystems, and countries’ economies. In the last two decades, the number and severity of natural disasters has significantly increased. Wireless communications and sensing are among other technologies promising improved disaster management. With the advancement, low cost, and flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), novel and dynamic communications and sensing solutions can be deployed at regions at risk in limited time. In this chapter, recent UAV-assisted network architecture and design considerations for disaster management are highlighted. Potential UAV-assisted networking solutions for disaster management are discussed and categorized based on the disaster type and phase. Case studies for UAV-assisted networks for earthquake recovery, wildfire detection, and biological diseases management are deeply discussed, highlighting implementation challenges and possible UAV-assisted solutions.”}

abstract = {This chapter is dedicated to the overview of extreme weather events and their impacts, as well as the introduction of forecasting concepts and techniques. There are many types of weather extremes that are accompanied by a continuously increasing research literature that contemplates interconnections between human and natural influences, especially with regard to climate change (Robinson, 2021). The events we describe in this chapter are not a complete list. We provide definitions of extreme weather events (Section 1.1) that pose significant societal and economic impacts and are represented by case studies in the chapters that follow. Most of the event types and techniques described here are analyzed further and more extensively in Chapter 2. An overview of current weather forecasting practices is presented in Section 1.2. Furthermore, in this chapter, we provide comprehensive reviews for extreme weather forecasting in urban areas (Section 1.3) and prediction of wildfires (Section 1.4). Urban areas represent scales and complex environments that affect a large part of the population. Wildfires, despite being primarily of natural origin, have a complex relationship with extreme weather conditions and increasingly devastating effects on the built environment and the society. Thus, we need to be able to better understand and predict them accurately in space and time.}

abstract = {Objective
To examine the prevalence and trend of experimental research on the effectiveness of ICT use in supporting the management of mass casualty incidents.
Methods
A systematic review was conducted in five electronic databases between February and March 2022 following the PRISMA guidelines. The analysis included studies published since 2012.
Results
A total of fifteen studies were included in the final analysis. Three themes were identified: 1) the response of medical teams to mass casualty incidents, 2) the simulation of mass casualty incidents, and 3) the digitisation of mass casualty incident workflows.
Conclusion
The available evidence is limited due to the relatively small number of studies on the use of information and communication technology and the response of emergency rescue teams to mass casualty incidents. Therefore, further research is needed on the impact of information and communication technology on the efficiency, work, and decision-making of incident commanders during mass casualty incidents. Furthermore, more dynamism is needed to accumulate knowledge and methodological expertise to explore experimental ideas in the European Union, where such research is lacking.}
