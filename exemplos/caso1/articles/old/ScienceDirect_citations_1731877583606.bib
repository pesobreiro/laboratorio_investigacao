abstract = {Floods, earthquakes, storm surges and other natural disasters severely affect the communication infrastructure and thus compromise the effectiveness of communications dependent rescue and warning services. In this paper, a user centric approach is proposed to establish communications in disaster affected and communication outage areas. The proposed scheme forms ad hoc clusters to facilitate emergency communications and connect end-users/ User Equipment (UE) to the core network. A novel cluster formation with single and multi-hop communication framework is proposed. The overall throughput in the formed clusters is maximized using convex optimization. In addition, an intelligent system is designed to label different clusters and their localities into affected and non-affected areas. As a proof of concept, the labeling is achieved on flooding dataset where region specific social media information is used in proposed machine learning techniques to classify the disaster-prone areas as flooded or unflooded. The suitable results of the proposed machine learning schemes suggest its use along with proposed clustering techniques to revive communications in disaster affected areas and to classify the impact of disaster for different locations in disaster-prone areas.}

We use the PINN to solve the level-set equation, which is a partial differential equation that models a fire-front through the zero-level-set of a level-set function. The result is a PINN that simulates a fire-front as it propagates through the spatio-temporal domain. We show that popular optimisation cost functions used in the literature can result in PINNs that fail to maintain temporal continuity in modelled fire-fronts when there are extreme changes in exogenous forcing variables such as wind direction. We thus propose novel additions to the optimisation cost function that improves temporal continuity under these extreme changes. Furthermore, we develop an approach to perform data assimilation within the PINN such that the PINN predictions are drawn towards observations of the fire-front. Finally, we incorporate our novel approaches into a Bayesian PINN (B-PINN) to provide uncertainty quantification in the fire-front predictions. This is significant as the standard solver, the level-set method, does not naturally offer the capability for data assimilation and uncertainty quantification. Our results show that, with our novel approaches, the B-PINN can produce accurate predictions with high quality uncertainty quantification on real-world data.}

abstract = {Australia's Great Western Woodlands are the largest intact temperate woodland ecosystem on Earth, spanning an area the size of the average European country. These woodlands are part of one of the world's biodiversity hotspots and, despite subsisting on just 200–400 mm of rainfall a year, can store considerable amounts of carbon. However, they face growing pressure from a combination of climate change and increasingly frequent and large wildfires, which have burned over a third of these slow-growing, fire-sensitive woodlands in last 50 years alone. To develop conservation strategies that bolster the long-term resilience of this unique ecosystem, we urgently need to understand how much old-growth woodland habitat remains intact and where it is distributed across this vast region. To tackle this challenge, we brought together data from an extensive network of field plots distributed across the region and combined this with information on vegetation 3D structure derived from drone, airborne and spaceborne LiDAR. Using this unique dataset, we developed a novel modelling framework to generate the first high-resolution maps of woodland tree size and age structure across the entire region. We found that 41.2% of the woodland habitat is covered by old-growth stands, equivalent to an area of approximately 39,187 km2. Only 10% of these old-growth woodlands fall within current protected areas managed by the state government. Instead, most remaining old-growth woodlands are found either within the Ngadju Indigenous Protected Area (26.9%) or outside of formal protected areas on leaseholds and privately owned lands (57.2%). Our maps of woodland size and age structure will help guide the targeted management and conservation of the Great Western Woodlands. Moreover, by developing a robust pipeline for integrating LiDAR data from multiple platforms, our study paves the way for mapping the 3D structure and carbon storage of open and heterogeneous woodland ecosystems from space.}

abstract = {Forest fragmentation has been increasingly exacerbated by deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion. Monitoring the forest fragments via the lens of tree-crown scale leaf phenology is critical to understand tree species phenological responses to climate change and identify the fragment species vulnerable to environmental disturbance. Despite advances in remote sensing for phenology monitoring, detecting tree-crown scale leaf phenology in fragmented forests remains challenging. Simultaneous tracking of key spring phenological events that are crucial to ecosystem functions and climate change responses is also neglected. To address these challenges, we develop a novel tree-crown scale remote sensing phenological monitoring framework to characterize all the critical spring phenological events of individual trees of deciduous forest fragments, with Trelease Woods in Champaign, Illinois as a case study. The novel framework comprises four components: 1) generate high spatiotemporal resolution fusion imagery from multi-scale satellite time series with a hybrid deep learning fusion model; 2) calibrate PlanetScope imagery time series with fusion data using histogram matching; 3) model tree-crown scale phenology trajectory with a Beck logistic-based method; 4) detect a diversity of tree-crown scale phenological events using several phenological metric extraction methods (i.e., threshold- and curve feature-based methods). Combined with weekly in-situ phenological observations of 123 individual trees across 12 broadleaf species from 2017 to 2020, the framework effectively bridges the satellite- and field-based phenological measures for the key spring phenological events (i.e., budswell, budburst, leaf expansion, and leaf maturity events) at the tree-crown scale, particularly for large individuals (RMSE <1 week for most events). Calibration of PlanetScope imagery using multi-scale satellite fusion data in consideration of landscape fragmentation is critical for monitoring tree phenology of forest fragments. Compared to curve feature-based methods, threshold-based phenometric extraction methods demonstrate enhanced capability in detecting spring leaf phenological dynamics of individual trees. Among the phenological events, full leaf out and early leaf expansion events are retrieved with high accuracy using calibrated PlanetScope time series (RMSE from 3 to 5 days and R-squared higher than 0.8). With both intensive satellite and field phenological efforts, this novel framework is at the forefront of interpreting tree-crown scale remotely sensed phenological metrics in the context of biologically meaningful field phenological events in fragmented forest setting.}

We train our approach using multiple swarm sizes and learning rates and compare our results using metrics such as the number of collisions. We also compare the ability of our approach to scale on swarms ranging from five to 25 agents using metrics and visual analysis. Our proposed solution was able to guide a swarm of up to 100 agents to a target while keeping a good swarm cohesion and avoiding collision.}

abstract = {Forest fires are known for their high level of randomness and unpredictability, which often lead to significant ecological damage and human life loss. Existing forest fire detection technologies are not capable of detecting small-scale flames or smoke in real time, thus failing to meet the demands of real-time detection of forest fires using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). To overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient and lightweight forest fire detection method that utilizes synthetic images and UAVs to achieve real-time and high-precision detection of forest fires against complex backgrounds. Firstly, we propose the Dilation Repconv Cross Stage Partial Network (DRCSPNet), which enhances the detection capabilities for multiscale flames and smoke using multi-branch parallel joint dilation convolution and batch normalization, while effectively extracting features from different stages of forest fires. Secondly, to mitigate challenges associated with extreme lighting in forest scenes and large contrast variation in fire images, we propose a Global Mixed-Attention (GMA) model across feature pyramids to enhance information lost in high-dimensional feature maps and increase the robustness of the model through a multiscale fusion strategy. Finally, we present the Lite-Path Aggregation Network (Lite-PAN) with varying scales to improve effective feature flow for multilevel forest fires, addressing challenges that arise from various climatic conditions. Furthermore, we employ Unreal Engine 5 to generate forest fire datasets in four scenarios to address the issue of relatively limited aerial forest fire datasets. According to the results of the experiment, our proposed method achieves 58.39% mAP(mean Average Precision) with 5.703 GFLOPs (Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second) while yielding a frame rate of 33.5 Frames Per Second (FPS) on NVIDIA Jetson NX. Extensive experiment results demonstrate our method has the advantage of being in real time, extremely accurate, and easily implementable compared to state-of-the-art techniques.}

Effective post-disaster debris management poses unique challenges due to limited resources, high expenses, and the nonhomogeneous and hazardous debris content. Current practices of debris cleanup rely on time-consuming and error-prone field-based estimation, which impedes immediate response and accurate analysis. While new approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) and crowdsourcing have shown promise in various domains, their potential for debris estimation remains underexplored. This study leverages a human-AI teaming workflow that estimates post-disaster debris volume and composition. The workflow begins with the utilization of drones to capture aerial views for efficient disaster infrastructure reconnaissance. Subsequently, an AI model and a crowdsourcing module are calibrated and work together to rapidly and reliably detect damaged buildings and classify the levels of damage based on aerial imagery. By establishing a connection between building damage states and the resulting generated debris, these damage level predictions serve as a foundation for the efficient and accurate estimation of debris. Overall, the proposed approach uses drones for rapid data collection and AI to automate damage detection and classification, which reduces the time required for debris estimation from days to a few hours as well as minimizes predictive uncertainty with crowdsourcing by up to 40%. A case study on Hurricane Laura in 2020 was conducted to validate the proposed approach. Findings of this study lead to predicting debris volume and composition with minimal errors, particularly for partially damaged buildings.}

Optical gas imaging (OGI) with infrared thermography is widely used in the field of gas leak monitoring and treatment by visualizing gases to quickly and accurately detect and locate the gas leak sources. However, this method still relies on manual visual inspection. Existing automatic visual gas detection methods suffer from insufficient gas feature extraction and high computational cost due to the indistinct gas features in thermal images. To address these problems, we propose a new lightweight network specialized for thermal gas feature extraction, namely GasViT, sufficiently extracting gas features at very low computational cost by local–global feature fusion. Specifically, two new feature extraction modules Multi-scale Fusion Feature Attention (MsFFA) and Multi-head Linear Self-attention (MhLSa) are proposed for GasViT. MsFFA enhances the gas local feature extraction ability by constructing multi-scale channel and spatial feature fusion maps, enabling the network to focus on more valid local information. MhLSa complements the gas global features with very low computational cost by efficiently encoding the global information of the image in terms of the innovative linear self-attention mechanism. Our experimental results on the self-made Industrial Invisible Gas (IIG) Dataset show GasViT achieves 82.7% mAP50, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art lightweight networks. Moreover, GasViT achieves 33 FPS real-time detection with a running memory footprint of only 47.2 MB on edge computing devices, making it extremely suitable for portable and embedded detection devices than existing methods to cover gas leakage detection in complex and hazardous industrial scenarios.}

Contrary to expectations, the presence of soft-stories and structural modifications, while significant in other contexts, did not exhibit a significant association with damage severity, suggesting unique responses to blast loads compared to other types of loading. The developed methodology can also be applied to other disaster types to better understand the attributes affecting the behavior of URM buildings in different contexts.

Despite a number of simplifying assumptions, the model is comprehensive enough to capture the major phenomena that govern the behaviour of a real fire — namely the pyrolysation of wood; the combustion of a mono-phase medium composed of premixed gas of fuel and air; and the heat transferred by conduction, convection, radiation, mass diffusion and transport due to atmospheric wind. The model consists of a system of coupled partial differential equations, one ensuring the balance of enthalpy, and a set of equations representing the mass formation of each chemical species involved in the combustion. Dimensionality reduction is sought by modelling these three-dimensional phenomena in a two-dimensional space, which has been achieved by means of heat-sources and heat-sinks to account for the third dimension in the energy balance equation. Once calibrated with a widely used non-physics-based commercial wildfire simulator, the proposed Fire Propagation Model for Fast simulations (FireProM-F) is tested, returning similar predictions in terms of the size and shape of the burnt area although similarity deteriorates for windy conditions. FireProM-F has the added benefit of being both physics-based and computationally inexpensive so that its interaction with fire suppressants may also be modelled in the future and simulated in real time.}

While disaster risk management (DRM) is a serious global challenge, governments, stakeholders, and practitioners among many other actors seek advanced solutions to reduce disaster-related costs. Recently, Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud platform used for planetary-scale geospatial analysis using big-data, has gained popularity due to its applications in various fields. While the availability of free satellite data has facilitated long-term spatial-temporal trends and patterns identification, cloud computing emerged as a reputable tool in geo-big data analyses. Yet nearly after ∼15 years of its launch, the impact of such cloud-computing platform on DRM (risk assessment, monitoring, and planning) has not been carefully explored. Hence, a systematic review regarding the current state and trends in GEE applications to DRM is needed, which could provide the community with the bigger picture of the subject matter. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the advancement in DRM with GEE being the primary platform used. For this, 547 peer-reviewed studies published in 208 different journals during 2010–2022 were assessed. The current spectrum of GEE applications is dominated by floods, drought, and wildfires. For data type, most of the studies used optical data (Landsat and Sentinel-2). In terms of geographical distribution, China, USA, and India dominate with highest articles published. Within this research domain, three emerging research themes (floods, forest fire, and classification) are observed. Our findings signify the emergence of GEE applications in DRM, which will continue making substantive progress on DRM-related multi-scale challenges.}

The weather extremes will intensify and threaten the well-being of the people in the tropical areas, and one of these intensifications would be wildfire burning. Over the years, Southeast Asia, Amazon, Australia, and East Coast of the United States of America have all experienced severe wildfires burning due to the proliferation of slash-and-burn practices, bad land use management, and natural causes; however, similarly climate change has played a crucial role in intensifying these burning conditions. The emission of these biomass burning haze also contains components that exhibit climatic forcing ability to modify the surface and atmospheric heat content as well as precipitation conditions. To control these wildfires, intervention requires the fundamental understanding of the burning source and the conducive weather conditions to assist the decision-making and preventive measurement. This is the intention of this chapter. The existing capabilities of the fire prediction models based on historical and continual monitoring tools and forest fire danger rating system are detailed and assessed. The chapter also discusses the future projection of the fire condition due to the changing climate condition and its potential implication and outlook.}

abstract = {This article explores how new technologies – such as drones and satellites – are incorporated into disaster management and questions the implications for power relations between disaster authorities and subjects. This is a critical area of research, as the proliferation of aerial and networked technologies has made their use in disaster management and response more common. Although concerns have been raised about the potential use of aerial and networked technologies in the surveillance and spatial discipline of populations by commercial and government actors, few have considered the implications for disaster management. In response, this article turns to geographical literature on necropower, verticality, and planetary spatialities to analyse technological innovations in responses to desert locust upsurges in Kenya. Drawing from qualitative research carried out between February 2020 and January 2021, we explain how desert locust control operations have shifted from horizontal to vertical to networked and planetary in nature through experimentation with new technologies over the past century. We argue that aerial and networked technologies have led to a volumetric shift in desert locust management and response, giving remote and increasingly automated actors who operate ‘above’ greater power over the life and death of populations ‘below’. In making this argument, we adopt a more-than-human perspective to account for how nonhuman entities and lifeforms shape and are subjected to necropolitical disaster management and responses. We conclude by reflecting on what this analytical approach has to offer the study of vertical and volumetric geographies.}

Sixteen flights over three days in June 2019 provided emission factors for a broad range of compounds including carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter < 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including carbonyls, black carbon, and elemental/organic carbon. To our knowledge, this is the first UAS-based emission sampling for a fire of this magnitude, including both slash pile and crown fires resulting in wildfire-like conditions. The burns consisted of drip torch ignitions as well as ground-mobile and aerial helicopter ignitions of large stands comprising over 1000 ha, allowing for comparison of same-species emission factors burned under different conditions. The use of a UAS for emission sampling minimizes risk to personnel and equipment, allowing flexibility in sampling location and ensuring capture of representative, fresh smoke constituents. PM2.5 emission factors varied 5-fold and, like most pollutants, varied inversely with combustion efficiency resulting in lower emission factors from the slash piles than the crown fires.}

However, without considering the prior knowledge, e.g., equal attention on both classes of the fire and non-fire samples, fire miss-detected phenomena frequently appeared in the current methods. In this work, considering model’s interpretability and the limited data for model-training, we propose a novel pixel-precision method, termed as PreVM (Preferred Vector Machine). To guarantee high fire detection rate under precise control, a new L0 norm constraint is introduced to the fire class. Computationally, instead of the traditional L1 re-weighted techniques in L0 norm approximation, this L0 constraint can be converted into linear inequality and incorporated into the process of parameter selection. To further speed up model-training and reduce error warning rate, we also present a kernel-based L1 norm PreVM (L1-PreVM). Theoretically, we firstly prove the existence of dual representation for the general Lp (p≥1) norm regularization problems in RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space). Then, we provide a mathematical evidence for L1 norm kernelization to conquer the case when feature samples do not appear in pairs. The work also includes an extensive experimentation on the real forest fire images and videos. Compared with the-state-of-art methods, the results show that our PreVM is capable of simultaneously achieving higher fire detection rates and lower error warning rates, and L1-PreVM is also superior in real-time detection.}

abstract = {Detailed maps of vegetation composition are vital for restoration planning, implementation, and monitoring, particularly at early stages of succession. This is usually accomplished through ground surveys, which can be costly and impractical depending on extent and accessibility, or conducted at too broad a spatial scale. In this study, we propose a methodology for mapping regenerating vegetation composition at 2 × 2 m2 spatial resolution, using very high spatial resolution (<1 m) remote sensing imagery obtained from remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS) in conjunction with digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) techniques for reconstructing vegetation structure. We applied logistic regression on multispectral orthomosaics, clusters of vegetation structure, and local illumination estimates to develop presence-absence models for eight key plant groups at various taxonomic levels as well as six plant functional types (conifer tree seedlings, grasses, tall- and low-growing forbs, shrubs, and mosses). Our results show higher accuracies for plant functional types (mean F-score = 0.67) compared to lower taxonomic levels (0.57). Notably, shrubs (F-score = 0.79), low-growing forbs (0.70), and mosses (0.69) exhibited the highest accuracies, while grasses (0.46), the aster family (Asteraceae spp; 0.48), and spruce seedlings (Picea spp; 0.54) demonstrated lower accuracies. Vegetation structure variables were identified as the most influential in the models, with mean NIRv ranking highest among spectral variables. High average ranks of spectral variation metrics (e.g., standard deviation of NIRv) implied the influence of environmental determinants such as plant co-occurrences and micro-habitat conditions, which drive spectral variation. Discrete composition maps were produced for three restoration sites and analogous wildfire-disturbed sites. Plant compositions found at one site pair exhibited similarity (Bray-Curtis = 0.28), however, certain key plant groups covered larger extents of the restoration site than anticipated. Willows (Salix spp; 25.4% vs. 9.3%), which are typically planted for soil stabilization and obstruction, and clovers (Trifolium spp; 11.1% vs. 3.6%), which represent non-native agronomic vegetation, were prominent. The developed methodology facilitates the generation of detailed plant composition maps, aiding evaluations of vegetation patterns that are difficult to discern visually or through conventional field sampling. This approach can effectively help assess restoration goals and guide adaptive management strategies, especially when incorporating the expertise of restoration ecologists in understanding how different vegetation types affect habitat quality.}

A crucial task in the aftermath of a disaster is to determine the veracity of the reported events alongside assessing their underlying urgency that can possibly facilitate appropriate parties in their disaster mitigation and recovery efforts. For example, identifying a falsely reported event early on thats claims fatalities could help divert alleviation efforts to genuinely critical events. However, existing SAS schemes are limited to deducing only the veracity of the reports on social data platforms and are unable to infer the underlying urgency of the events. In this paper, we explore the opportunity to develop a spatiotemporal-aware event investigation framework for SAS that can jointly determine the veracity of reported events as well as infer their underlying urgency and deadlines. However, constructing such an integrated system introduces a few new technical challenges. The first challenge is handling the predominant data sparsity in the incoming social signals. The second challenge is optimizing the UAV deployment and event veracity estimation processes by scrutinizing the highly dynamic and latent correlations among event characteristics. The third challenge is carefully extracting and analyzing latent semantic features embedded in the social media data to infer the event urgency. To address the above challenges, we introduce the Spatiotemporal-aware Event Investigation for SAS (SEIS) framework that harnesses techniques from natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and spatial–temporal correlation modeling for deducing the veracity, urgency and deadlines of the underlying events. Experiments through a real-world disaster recovery dataset demonstrate that SEIS achieves better event veracity estimation, event urgency inference, and deadline hit rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines.}

Existing fire detection models face limitations in dataset availability, multi-scale feature extraction, and locating obscured or small flames and smoke. To address these issues, we develop a dataset containing real and synthetic forest fire images, sourced from a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) perspective. Additionally, we propose the Ghost Convolution Swin Transformer (GCST) module to extract multi-scale flame and smoke features from different receptive fields by integrating parallel Ghost convolution and Swin Transformer. Subsequently, we design a lightweight reparameterized rotation attention module, which captures interactions across channel and spatial dimensions to suppress background noise and focus on obscured flames and smoke. Finally, we introduce a loss function, called Efficient Auxiliary Geometric Intersection over Union (EAGIoU), which employs an auxiliary bounding box to accelerate the model's convergence while integrating the geometrical principles of the predicted and real bounding boxes to accurately locate small flames and smoke. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 75.2 % mAP@0.5 and 42 % mAP@0.5:0.95 with a frame rate of 239 frames per second, indicating a significant improvement in accuracy and real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Existing research predominantly provides an on-site perspective, frequently missing the complexities of real-world applications. The objectives of this paper are to investigate the transferability and generalization capabilities of yield prediction models for crop breeding across test sites located in North and South Americas. Toward that goal, we tested different machine learning techniques including Random Forest Regressor (RF), Gradient Boosting Regression (GB), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for soybean yield prediction with experiments conducted in different climate and growth conditions. A novel transfer learning approach was proposed for genotype selection and categorizing soybean yield for screening high-yield varieties. Furthermore, we studied the effect of temporal resolution on yield prediction, focusing on the critical development stages and optimal aerial survey frequencies for precise yield prediction using large 31,404 sample data. Results demonstrated that the combined dataset of Argentina and United States representing different climate regimes provided the highest performance with an R2 of 0.76 using RF and GB algorithms. The classification approach was proven to be most useful for crop breeding as demonstrated by accurately identifying the high-yielding genotypes. Increasing temporal sampling of key phenological stages significantly improved yield prediction. Although transfer learning yielded promising outcomes across trials within Argentina the efficacy of transferring models from Argentina to the United States was limited, attributed to significant seasonal and climate variations. This study pioneered the use of transfer learning for model adaptability in real-world breeding scenarios, training and transferring models within the South and North Americas, providing actionable insights and strategies for the breeding community, aiming to facilitate improved decision-making for agricultural productivity.}

Here, we present a comprehensive synthesis aiming to identify common rules that shape workflows applied in UAS-based studies facing complexity in ecosystems. Analysing the studies, we found similarities irrespective of the ecosystem, according to the character of the property addressed, such as species composition (biodiversity), ecosystem structure (stand volume/complexity), plant status (phenology and stress levels), and dynamics (disturbances and regeneration). We propose a general framework allowing to design UAS-based vegetation surveys according to its purpose and the component of ecosystem complexity addressed. We support the framework by detailed schemes as well as examples of best practices of UAS studies covering each of the vegetation properties (i.e. composition, structure, status and dynamics) and related applications. For an efficient UAS survey, the following points are crucial: knowledge of the phenomenon, choice of platform, sensor, resolution (temporal, spatial and spectral), model and classification algorithm according to the phenomenon, as well as careful interpretation of the results. The simpler the procedure, the more robust, repeatable, applicable and cost effective it is. Therefore, the proper design can minimize the efforts while maximizing the quality of the results.}

The floating meadows of Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP) in Manipur, India, are the only home to the last remaining wild population of the endangered and endemic Eld’s Deer, locally known as Sangai (Rucervus eldii eldii). Besides the rampant change in land use and altering water regimes induced by anthropogenic pressure, monitoring the population and habitat quality remains challenging. Moreover, conventional in-situ surveys that involve infiltrating animal habitats could adversely affect the habits and behavior of such shy species as a response to human presence. This study assesses the scope of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to non-invasively access such a challenging habitat and detect the ungulate individuals of interest. A quadcopter, mounted with an optical (RGB) and a thermal camera, was tested in this landscape conditions for its durability, failsafe range, flexibility, camera capabilities for visualization and detection, and resolution. The results of the drone survey based on three different time frames suggest that it is feasible to soar through the floating meadows to detect deer, best during dawn and dusk. Detection yielded the best results without creating a disturbance in animal behavior, with thermal infrared (TIR) imaging at night and both TIR and optical during the early morning. A flying height of nearly 90 m with RGB for vegetation and 20–25 m with TIR for animal presence yielded the best results. We have also established the least distracting sampling technique by analyzing the behavioral response of the deer to the presence of a drone. This study has paved a safe and practical way for acquiring accurate ground information that can assist in population estimation, habitat assessment, and burnt area estimation due to wildfire, to aid the conservation of an invaluable natural asset.}

To bridge this gap, this study provides a comprehensive systematic review of the burgeoning landscape of smarter eco-cities and their leading-edge AI and AIoT solutions for environmental sustainability. To ensure thoroughness, the study employs a unified evidence synthesis framework integrating aggregative, configurative, and narrative synthesis approaches. At the core of this study lie these subsequent research inquiries: What are the foundational underpinnings of emerging smarter eco-cities, and how do they intricately interrelate, particularly urbanism paradigms, environmental solutions, and data-driven technologies? What are the key drivers and enablers propelling the materialization of smarter eco-cities? What are the primary AI and AIoT solutions that can be harnessed in the development of smarter eco-cities? In what ways do AI and AIoT technologies contribute to fostering environmental sustainability practices, and what potential benefits and opportunities do they offer for smarter eco-cities? What challenges and barriers arise in the implementation of AI and AIoT solutions for the development of smarter eco-cities? The findings significantly deepen and broaden our understanding of both the significant potential of AI and AIoT technologies to enhance sustainable urban development practices, as well as the formidable nature of the challenges they pose. Beyond theoretical enrichment, these findings offer invaluable insights and new perspectives poised to empower policymakers, practitioners, and researchers to advance the integration of eco-urbanism and AI- and AIoT-driven urbanism. Through an insightful exploration of the contemporary urban landscape and the identification of successfully applied AI and AIoT solutions, stakeholders gain the necessary groundwork for making well-informed decisions, implementing effective strategies, and designing policies that prioritize environmental well-being.}

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a method for quantitative analysis of height growth in planted Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) stands at a regional scale. In two model regions (Gujo, Gifu and Kami, Kochi), overall tree height data were measured using airborne LiDAR, and target stand data were extracted by overlaying geographic information from a forest GIS database. A statistical model was used to quantitatively assess tree height data as a response variable, and forest age, climate and topographic factors as explanatory variables. Although there were errors in both regions due to data characteristics and unaccounted factors, tree height was estimated with high accuracy after bias correction (Gujo: rho = 0.98, Kami: rho = 0.90). The importance of climatic and topographic factors differed significantly between regions. In Gujo, which experiences relatively cool conditions, stand age (20.9%) and Warmth index (10.6%) were important determinants of tree height growth, whereas in Kami, with warm and rainy conditions, aspect (23.8%) and stand age (16.6%) were more important. The model developed in this study was used to predict the potential tree height of Japanese cedar stands aged 20–100 years. The potential growth pattern in Gujo was characterised by high growth in the warmer eastern and southern regions, but low growth in the higher-elevation and colder northern and western regions. In Kami, the pattern was more topographically complex, with lower height growth on southwestern slopes. Evaluating the potential growth at a site and predicting its future productivity will not only support suitable forestry management, but also allow sustainable and effective use of forest resources.}

abstract = {Linear disturbances from geological exploration (i.e., seismic lines) have an extensive footprint across much of Canada’s western boreal forest; however, how seismic lines interact with subsequent wildfire remains poorly understood. We assessed whether wildfires effectively mitigate the footprint of seismic lines by promoting forest recovery. We evaluated the forest structure of legacy seismic lines burned in 2001 and 2002 by comparing them against adjacent unburned control plots, using metrics derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data collected between 2007 and 2009. ALS metrics identified persistent differences in vegetation height and structure between seismic lines and adjacent forest controls, 7–9 years post-fire. Median canopy height was 2.90 m lower on upland seismic lines and 1.94 m lower on lowland seismic lines than on adjacent controls, corresponding to a 21% and 25% height reduction, respectively. Field surveys revealed greater graminoid and nonvascular plant cover, and lower tall-tree cover and dead vegetative matter, on seismic lines, in comparison with controls. Our results show that tree recovery remains significantly delayed on most upland and lowland burned seismic lines in our study area, and that additional management efforts or longer timescales may be required to restore these fragmented landscapes.
Les perturbations linéaires associées à l’exploration géologique (c.-à-d. les lignes sismiques) ont une vaste empreinte dans une grande partie de la forêt boréale de l’ouest du Canada. Cependant, on comprend mal de quelle façon les lignes sismiques interagissent par la suite avec les feux de forêt. Nous avons évalué si les feux de forêt atténuent effectivement l’empreinte des lignes sismiques en favorisant la récupération de la forêt. Nous avons évalué la structure de la forêt laissée en héritage par des lignes sismiques qui ont brûlé en 2001 et 2002 en les comparant à des parcelles témoins adjacentes non brûlées, à l’aide de mesures dérivées de données de balayage laser aéroporté (BLA) recueillies entre 2007 et 2009. Les mesures obtenues par BLA ont permis d’identifier des différences persistantes dans la hauteur et la structure de la végétation entre les lignes sismiques et les parcelles témoins adjacentes, 7 à 9 ans après le feu. La hauteur médiane du couvert forestier était 2,90 m plus courte dans les lignes sismiques des hautes terres et 1,94 m plus courte dans les lignes sismiques des basses terres que dans les témoins adjacents; ce qui correspond à une réduction de la hauteur de respectivement 21 et 25 %. Des relevés de terrain ont révélé la présence d’un couvert plus important de plantes non vasculaires et graminiformes, ainsi qu’un couvert moins important de grands arbres et de matière végétale morte dans les lignes sismiques, comparativement aux témoins. Nos résultats montrent que la récupération des arbres est significativement décalée dans les lignes sismiques brûlées sur les hautes et basses terres dans notre zone d’étude, et que des efforts additionnels d’aménagement ou des délais plus longs pourraient être nécessaires pour restaurer ces paysages fragmentés.

abstract = {Shaded fuel breaks are treatments that aim to mitigate wildfires by establishing linearly aligned locations where wildfire suppression efforts can be more effective at stopping wildfires. Despite the potential of fuel breaks to alter fire behavior, there have been limited quantitative assessments of their effectiveness following exposure to wildfires. In addition, wildfires often occurin complex terrains that are difficult to access with ground vehicles and sensors, posing challenges for data acquisition. However, the use of Remote-controlled Aerial Vehicles (RAVs), such as drones, is becoming increasingly popular as a viable means of conducting high-resolution observations in areas of interest. This study presents the results from a unique opportunity to utilize three distinct observation scale platforms (in-situ, aerial, and spaceborne) to investigate the burn severity impacts across a prior shaded fuel break that serendipitously encountered the 2020 Creek Fire in the Sierra Nevada forests of California, USA. To provide a direct measure of fire severity, ground-based measurements determined the percentage crown volume (PCV) of scorch and char as a function of distance from the fuel break edge. Along five transects of the fuel break, we also utilized visible bands from drone imagery and digital photogrammetry, to generate georeferenced orthophotos and quantify vegetation health using the Green Leaf Index (GLI). We also quantified burn severity by computing the Delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and vegetation health using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel 2 spaceborne observations. Our results indicate that within the fuel break, the PCV of char is 2 × less than it was outside of it (with PCV char declining at a rate of 2% per 3 m into the fuel break). Burn severity is 5 × less, and vegetation health is approximately 3 × greater within the fuel break compared to directly outside. Furthermore, postfire vegetation health was only 1 × less within the fuel break compared to the pre fire condition, whereas it was 5 × less in the surrounding region. The results confirm that the fuel break altered the fire behavior, reducing the fire intensity, thereby proving effective at reducing fire burn severity and preserving vegetation health within the fuel break.}

Although information on outbreak extent and severity underpins forest management and research, the data products available in Alaska have substantial gaps. Widely available high-resolution satellite imagery are a promising data source for detecting beetle kill because it is possible, though challenging, to identify individual trees. However, the applicability of automated deep-learning approaches for regional-scale mapping has not been evaluated. Here, we assess a deep convolutional network for mapping dead spruce in high-resolution (∼2m) satellite imagery of Southcentral Alaska. The network identified dead spruce pixels across stand characteristics, achieving an average accuracy of 95%. To upscale to the stand scale, we mitigated overestimation of dead tree pixels at elevated severity by calibration. Stand-scale areal severity, the fraction of dead spruce pixels within a stand, was mapped with an RMSE of 0.02 at 90m scale. The estimated severity exceeded 0.05 in fewer than 4% of the landscape, and approximately 90% of dead trees pixels were found in low-severity stands. Severity was weakly associated with stand-scale Landsat reflectance changes, a clear relation between SWIR reflectance change and severity only emerging above 0.1 severity. In conclusion, high-resolution satellite imagery are suited to automated mapping of beetle-associated kill at tree and stand scale across the severity spectrum. Such data products support forest and fire management and further understanding of the dynamics and consequences of beetle outbreaks.}

Identifying and mapping both living and dead trees is crucial for understanding the causes and implementing effective management strategies. This study explores the efficacy of Mask R–CNN for automated forest dieback monitoring. The method detects individual trees, delineates their crowns, and classifies them as alive or dead. We evaluated the approach using aerial imagery and canopy height models in the Harz Mountains, Germany, a region severely affected by forest dieback. To assess the model's ability to track changes over time, we applied it to images from three separate flight campaigns (2009, 2016, and 2022). This evaluation considered variations in acquisition dates, cameras, post-processing techniques, and image tilting. Forest changes were analyzed based on the detected trees' number, spatial distribution, and height. A comprehensive accuracy assessment demonstrated the Mask R–CNN's robust performance, with precision scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.88 and F1-scores from 0.88 to 0.91. These results confirm the model's ability to generalize across diverse image acquisition conditions. While minor changes were observed between 2009 and 2016, the period between 2016 and 2022 witnessed substantial dieback, with a 64.57% loss of living trees. Notably, taller trees appeared to be particularly affected. This study highlights Mask R–CNN's potential as a valuable tool for automated forest dieback monitoring. It enables efficient detection, delineation, and classification of both living and dead trees, providing crucial data for informed forest management practices.}

abstract = {One crucial mechanism in the spread of wildfires is the so-called fire-spotting: a random phenomenon that occurs when embers are transported over large distances. Fire-spotting speeds up the rate of spread and starts new ignitions that can jeopardise firefighting operations. Unfortunately, operational fire-spread simulators may not account for spotting events, thus overlooking the harmful consequences associated with this phenomenon. In this work, three fire spotting parametrisations are integrated in the operational wildfire simulator PROPAGATOR based on Cellular Automata (CA). RandomFront, a physics-based parametrisation of fire-spotting, is tested for the first time in the context of CA simulators. RandomFront is compared with other two parametrisations already adopted in CA based simulators, those by Alexandridis and co-authors and by Perryman and collaborators. A wildfire occurred in the summer of 2021 in the municipality of Campomarino (Molise, Italy), and where spotting effects were clearly reported, is used as a case study. This case study, featuring evident airborne transport of firebrands, paves the way for a framework for comparing parameterised spotting models used in operational scenarios. RandomFront produced a more complex burning probability pattern than the other parametrisations and it predicted a higher probability of burning in the zone mainly affected by the fire-spotting.}

abstract = {Jordan is witnessing major transformations in its environmental and topographic features, where the desert dominates a large part of the territory, with very limited forest areas. Over the last three decades, Jordan has lost about a third of its natural forests at an annual rate of 1.6%. In this study, we develop a deep learning model to automatically monitor deforestation in Jordan based on the semantic segmentation of multitemporal Landsat-8 satellite images. Very few studies and datasets are devoted to monitoring forest cover changes using semantic image segmentation with deep neural networks. Therefore, we have collected a new benchmarking dataset of Jordanian forests between 2010 and 2020. The proposed model includes an efficient encoder-decoder architecture, with which we can extract a set of discriminating features that semantically assign every key image pixel into either forest or non-forest classes. The deep architecture is first initialised by a CNN-based pre-trained model and then it is fine-tuned on the forest images through an effective transfer learning procedure to improve its generalisation ability. Then, a set of key features are extracted by encoding each forest image into low-dimensional semantic maps to formulate the generic descriptors used in image segmentation. Finally, the output of the segmentation process is used to detect any dissimilarity in the forest area or boundaries using an absolute pixel-pixel similarity check over many years. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model in segmenting the forest images and predicting any loss (deforestation) or gain (reforestation), and the model achieved an accuracy of 94.8% and MIoU of 82.1%. Moreover, the deep semantic features are discriminative enough to efficiently identify and estimate the amount of deforestation change in terms of accuracy and computational resources.}

Most previous research on boreal forest fires has occurred in North American forests which have different fire regimes, tree species and are less intensively managed than their Eurasian counterparts. Recent extreme fire years have highlighted the vulnerability of the Nordic boreal forest to climatic shifts that are increasing forest fire frequency and severity. The Ljusdal fire (2018) was one of the largest wildfires in recorded history in Sweden. We established eddy covariance flux towers to track the impacts of this fire on the carbon balance of two Pinus sylvestris sites subject to different fire severities and forest management strategies 1–4 years post-fire. The ‘SLM’ site was a mature stand that experienced low-severity fire (trees survived) followed by salvage-logging and reseeding, whilst the ‘HY’ site was 10 years old when it experienced high-severity fire (all trees killed) then was replanted with seedlings. During the study period, both sites were net carbon sources at the annual scale. It took up to 4 years after the fire until the first day of net CO2 uptake was recorded at each site. We estimated that it will take 13 years (8, 21; mean ± 95 % confidence intervals) after the fire until the sites reach a neutral annual carbon balance. It will take up to 32 years (19, 53) at HY and 46 years (31, 70) at SLM to offset the carbon lost during and after the fire and salvage-logging. In addition, our measurements showed that more carbon was emitted in the first 4 years after the fire compared to the carbon lost from combustion during the fire. Quantifying carbon fluxes during the initial years after fire is therefore crucial for estimating the net impact of wildfire on the carbon budget of boreal forests.}

As a result, accurate monitoring of the plant's water condition has become imperative. Internet of Things (IoT) solutions based on specific sensor data acquisition and intelligent processing can assist water users for precise irrigation by providing accurate, consistent, and fast results. This paper aims to present a hybrid deep learning approach based on the combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for automatically identifying the water state of wheat. The intended scheme used IoT-based data transmission devices such as a digital camera, soil moisture, wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity. These environmental factors (EF) were recorded during the plant image capture. A total of 876 images of wheat plants were collected under different water deficit levels. A data augmentation approach was applied to expand the size of the training dataset to 5256 images. Various types of image color modes for example CMYK (cyan-magenta-yellow-black), HSV (hue-saturation-value), RGB (red-greenblue), and grayscale were evaluated with our proposed methods. The experimental results indicated that the combined CNNRGB-LSTMEF-CNNEF deep network based on features from both RGB images, climatic conditions, and soil moisture performed better than features from individual RGB images. Its outputs of validation accuracy, classification precision, recall, F-measure, and intersection over union are 100% with a loss of 0.0012. The proposed system behavior is very encouraging to develop our methodology with other crops in the future. The designed framework can serve the agricultural community to detect the water stress of plants before the critical level of growth and make timely management decisions.}

New developments in fields like communication technology and the UAV needs to be able to act autonomously by gathering data and then making choices. These tendencies have brought us to cutting-edge levels of health care, transportation, energy, monitoring, and security for visual image detection and manufacturing endeavors. These include coordination in communication via IoT, sustainability of IoT network, and optimization challenges in path planning. Because of their limited battery life, these gadgets are limited in their range of communication. UAVs can be seen as terminal devices connected to a large network where a swarm of other UAVs is coordinating their motions, directing one another, and maintaining watch over locations outside its visual range. One of the essential components of UAV-based applications is the ability to recognize objects of interest in aerial photographs taken by UAVs. While aerial photos might be useful, object detection is challenging. As a result, capturing aerial photographs with UAVs is a unique challenge since the size of things in these images might vary greatly. The study proposal included specific information regarding the Detection of Visual Images by UAVs (DVI-UAV) using the IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Included in the study of AI is the concept of DSYolov3. The DSYolov3 model was presented to deal with these problems in the UAV industry. By fusing the channel-wise feature across multiple scales using a spatial pyramid pooling approach, the proposed study creates a novel module, Multi-scale Fusion of Channel Attention (MFCAM), for scale-variant object identification tasks. The method's effectiveness and efficiency have been thoroughly tested and evaluated experimentally. The suggested method would allow us to outperform most current detectors and guarantee that the models will be useable on UAVs. There will be a 95 % success rate in terms of visual image detection, a 94 % success rate in terms of computation cost, a 97 % success rate in terms of accuracy, and a 95 % success rate in terms of effectiveness.}

In order to prevent power failures, timely and thorough powerline inspections are needed to detect possible anomalies in advance. In the past few years, the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted sensors (e.g. light detection and ranging/lidar, optical cameras, infrared cameras, and ultraviolet cameras) have provided rich data sources for comprehensive and accurate powerline inspections. A challenge that still hinders the use of UAVs in powerline inspection is that their operation is highly dependent on the pilot’s experience, which may pose risks to the safety of the powerline system and reduce inspection efficiency. An intelligent automatic inspection solution could overcome the limitations of current UAV-based inspection solutions. The main objective of this paper is to provide a contemporary look at the current state-of-the-art UAV-based inspections as well as to discuss a potential lidar-supported intelligent powerline inspection concept. Overall, standardized protocols for lidar-supported intelligent powerline inspections include four data analysis steps, i.e., point cloud classification, key point extraction, route generation, and fault detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we implemented a workflow using a dataset of 3536 powerline spans, showing that the inspection of a single powerline span could be completed in 10 min with only one or two technicians. This demonstrates that lidar-supported intelligent inspection can be used to inspect a powerline system with extremely high efficiency and low costs.}

Here, we applied an array of machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to estimate the relative importance of various factors in observed patterns of Eastern Siberian fires mapped with satellite data. More specifically, we tested linkages of “hot spot” ignitions with 42 variables representing landscape characteristics, climatic, and anthropogenic factors, such as human population density, locations of settlements and road networks. Analysis of data spanning seventeen years (2001–2017) showed that during low or moderately high fire seasons, models with full set of variables predict locations of fires with a very high probability (AUC = 95%). Sensitivity, or the ratio of correctly predicted fire pixels to the total number of pixels analyzed, declined to 30–40% during warm and dry years of increased fire activity, especially in models driven by anthropogenic variables only. This analysis demonstrates that if warming in Eastern Siberia continues, forest fires will become not only more frequent but also less predictable. We explain this by examining model performance as a function of either temperature or precipitation. This effect from climate makes it nearly impossible to segregate ignition points from locations, which were burnt several hours or even several days earlier. An increase in secondary burnt locations makes it difficult for machine learning algorithms to establish causality links with anthropogenic and other groups of variables.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been extensively applied in farming recently. To cultivate healthier crops, manage pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, analyse data for farmers, and enhance other management activities of the food supply chain, the agriculture sector is turning to AI technology. It makes it challenging for farmers to choose the ideal time to plant seeds. AI helps farmers choose the optimum seed for a particular weather scenario. It also offers data on weather forecasts. AI-powered solutions will help farmers produce more with fewer resources, increase crop quality, and hasten product time to reach the market. AI aids in understanding soil qualities. AI helps farmers by suggesting the nutrients they should apply to increase the quality of the soil. AI can help farmers choose the optimal time to plant their seeds. Intelligent equipment can calculate the spacing between seeds and the maximum planting depth. An AI-powered system known as a health monitoring system provides farmers with information on the health of their crops and the nutrients that need to be given to enhance yield quality and quantity. This study identifies and analyses relevant articles on AI for Agriculture. Using AI, farmers can now access advanced data and analytics tools that will foster better farming, improve efficiencies, and reduce waste in biofuel and food production while minimising the negative environmental impacts. AI and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed various industries, and the AI wave has now reached the agriculture sector. Companies are developing several technologies to make monitoring farmers' crop and soil health easier. Hyperspectral imaging and 3D laser scanning are the leading AI-based technologies that can help ensure crop health. These AI-powered technologies collect precise data on the health of the crops in greater volume for analysis. This paper studied AI and its need in Agriculture. The process of AI in Agriculture and some Agriculture parameters monitored by AI are briefed. Finally, we identified and discussed the significant applications of AI in agriculture.}

abstract = {Accurate documentation and mitigation of wildfires is significant in addressing Sustainable Goal eleven (11) as well as the African Unions Agenda 2063 Goal one (1) which resonate an intention to preserve sustainable environments, communities, and cities for future generations. Poor and unscientific documentation of wildfire leads to error prone and quickly outdated event curation, making it difficult to create comprehensive overviews of wildfire events. Although several geospatial studies have recorded advances in wildfire data curation, many of these rely on structured spatial datasets which enjoy numerous advantages but can be prone to temporal or time-voids in data. Voids in data can be mitigated through interpolation techniques, but these are not without challenges for the modellers tasked with optimally filling the voids. On this backdrop, this paper therefore aims to test and extend strategies of wildfire reporting by investigating the strengths of fusing mainstream spatial data (including high resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) footage) with unstructured Twitter (tweets) data in order to disrupt common practise and contribute to the global agenda. The novelty of this contribution lies in its unusual hybrid data approach used to statistically establishes long- and short-term pre-fire conditions tested on the African landscape. It proceeds to illustrate how the social media data can create fascinating and yet accurate visual timelines of the events that surprisingly compared strongly to the results from structured sources. Finally, the study detects the extent of damage from the wildfire using supervised classification, burn indices and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction. A 95% positive detection rate was reported, and it affirmed the place of unstructured data in mainstream scientific approaches such as wildfire documentation. The work presented therefore contributes towards meeting African Union's Agenda 2063 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2030) in curation, documentation and mitigation of sustainable community and environments.}

abstract = {There is a pressing need for well-informed management to reduce wildfire hazard and restore fire's beneficial ecological role in the Mediterranean- and temperate-climate forests of California, USA. These efforts rely upon the accessibility of high spatial and temporal resolution data on biomass and canopy fuel parameters such as canopy base height (CBH), mean canopy height, canopy bulk density (CBD), canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI). Remote sensing using unoccupied aerial system Structure-from-Motion (UAS-SfM) presents a promising technology for this application due to its accessibility, relatively low cost, and possibility for high temporal cadence. However, to date, this method has not been studied in the complex mosaic of forest types found across California. In this study we examined the capacity of structural and multispectral information obtained from UAS-SfM, in conjunction with machine learning methods, to model aboveground biomass and forest canopy fuel structural parameters using an area-based approach across multiple sites representing a diversity of forest types in California. Based on correlations with field measurements, fuel parameters separated into vertical (biomass, CBH, and mean height) and horizontal (LAI, CBD, canopy cover) groups. UAS-SfM random forest models performed well for modelling the vertical structure canopy fuels parameters (R2 0.69–0.75). These models exhibited strong performance in comparison to ALS, as well as when transferred to a novel site. Vertical structure predictors were prominent in these models, and did not improve with the addition of spectral predictors. UAS-SfM random forest models of horizontal structure parameters mainly used raster-based spectral indices (primarily NDVI) and had relatively low performance (R2 0.49–0.59). In addition, these models underperformed ALS and had poor performance when applied to a novel site. When applied to a region with widespread UAS-SfM coverage, models from both groups successfully produced contiguous maps that could be used for modelling fire behavior or in management decision making and monitoring. These findings indicate that UAS-SfM, without the need for multispectral sensors, is well suited for mapping area-based vertical-structure canopy parameters across diverse landscapes supporting a wide range of forest types. In contrast, the identification of spectral mean variables for modelling horizontal structure canopy fuels suggests the potential of multi- or hyperspectral sensors or high-resolution satellite imagery for meeting management information needs.}

FANETs research is being driven by the potential for UAVs to be utilized in these regions. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most important FANET characteristics, mobility models, applications, and routing protocols. The present paper is an effort to provide a comprehensive description of the various routing techniques utilized by the most prevalent routing protocols in FANETs, including topology-based, position- based, hierarchical, swarm-based, and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocols. Reinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning are both encompassed in a newly anticipated classification. In the meanwhile, this study primarily centres around the taxonomy for learning agents (single- agent, multi-agent) and learning models (model-based and free-model). In addition, the paper intends to shed light on identifying the applications of FANETs in various categories and identify research gaps and future opportunities in this field. In addition, it compares the results qualitatively to those of the previous surveys. Any future work on the FANET routing protocol could benefit from this paper as a reference and roadmap.}

abstract = {Peat wildfires are the largest fires on Earth involving both flaming and smouldering combustion, with one leading to the other. A common ignition source of smouldering fires in tropical peatlands are intentional flaming fires used to clear surface vegetation. To capture the behaviour of these fires, it is necessary to consider the interaction between flaming vegetation and smouldering peat. However, doing so is infeasible with the state-of-the-art wildfire models, as they do not consider the transition from flaming to smouldering and are computationally too expensive at the field-scale hundreds of hectares. In this work, we overcome these limitations and model both flaming and smouldering at the field-scale using cellular automata: that is a discrete mathematical model that uses simple rules to capture complex behaviour while remaining computationally light. The model was calibrated against existing experiments in the literature and used to predict the effect of peat moisture content on the behaviour of peatland wildfires. The model shows how flaming creates smouldering hotspots and how these hotspots merge – flaming spreads rapidly, consuming surface vegetation, leaving behind hotspots of smouldering peat which consumes most of the peat. The model was then applied to study a real prescribed fire of 573 ha peatland in Borneo in 2015, observed by drone footage. The model captured the spread patterns of the fire and predicted that 2.9 ha of peatland burnt after 3 months with 70% peat moisture content (dry-based). This ioutcome could have been reduced to 0.02 ha if the peat moisture content had been above 100%. This work improves the fundamental understanding of how peat wildfires spread at the field scale which has received little attention until now.}

But the achievement of effective responses and proper utility, still remains a challenging task. It is required to analyze multi-source data of UAVs-RN, so that optimal planning schemes under MIoT can be found. To bridge such gap, this work mainly takes three aspects of factors into consideration: rapid response, finite budget and uncertain signal fading. Accordingly, a data-driven intelligent planning model for UAVs-RN under MIoT, is put forward in this paper. Data about wildfire happened in local areas of Australia is selected to build experimental scenarios. And two kinds of UAVs, Surveillance and Situational Awareness drones and Radio Repeater drones, are considered in this study. Firstly, the source data is visualized and the internal trend is analyzed to verify true validity. Then, a multi-objective planning model is accordingly established to aggregate multi-source data. At last, a case study is deeply investigated on real-world data to assess the proposed approach and suggest feasible planning schemes.}

Vegetation composition and structure are recognised indicators for carbon sequestration and storage potential in these ecosystems, but decadal dynamics and roles of autogenic succession, climate, and land-use herein remain poorly understood. We assessed vegetation changes in the least disturbed centre of twelve Irish peatland reserves sampled across a gradient in temperature and precipitation between 1978(1983)–2021, combining re-classified traditional high-resolution vegetation maps with recent very high-resolution drone imagery. Specifically, we tested whether microform proportions of open water, wet hollow, moist lawn, and dry hummock had changed and explored to what extent changes were related to climate and land-use drivers. Results revealed that the studied peatlands underwent an overall unidirectional surface drying trend, with dry hummocks expanding at the expense of open water and wet hollow, while moist lawns remained approximately equal in proportions. The degree of change varied between the studied peatlands, with western blanket bogs and unrestored raised bogs experiencing more surface drying than mountain blanket bogs and raised bogs under hydrological restoration. While our results indicated climate and/or land-use as drivers of surface drying, our sample size was too small to make definitive conclusions about their exact role. The overall change from wet to dry surface conditions between 1978 and 2021 occurred at a much faster rate than hitherto reported for these slow-changing ecosystems. This raises concern for the future resilience of peatlands to changes in climate and land-use, as well as their potential impact on the peatland carbon balance.}

In this work, we identify the requirements and the constraints in terms of computational resources of this workflow, and investigate lightweight CNNs to be used. SqueezeNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNetv2 as well as ResNet50 are used for fire identification. To simulate the realistic conditions, we have investigated multiple datasets, selecting Forest-Fire and Fire-Flame datasets and images from 3rd party sources and performed cross-dataset identification evaluation. To rationalize the required computational resources and the operation cost, lightweight networks have been selected and compared with ResNet-50, which is more complex. The contextualization, i.e. the detection of elements related to energy infrastructures, has been based on image semantic segmentation, performed through ResNet-18. The identification results, expressed as classification accuracy has reached 96%, with satisfactory results in the cross dataset scenarios, while we have identified five classes from the CamVid dataset which can be used for the contextualization needs.}

abstract = {Forest fires, influenced by climatic and ecological changes, pose significant risks to global ecosystems and human communities. To address this challenge, our research introduces a segmentation method that integrates vision transformers (ViT) with conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Within this framework, MobileViT serves as the basic architecture, with CNNs enhancing spatial resolution. Our model also incorporates the CBAM attention mechanism, the Dense ASPP module, and SP pooling to enhance segmentation performance. The model, optimized for lightweight and efficiency, achieved an F1-score of 87.2 % and a mIoU of 81.44 % on our custom dataset that underwent data augmentation. In addition, ablation experiments validate the value of each module in the performance of the composite model. Collectively, this research aims to advance real-time wildland fire monitoring capabilities. In addition, its potential extends to a broader range of applications encompassing various agricultural and forestry challenges.}

abstract = {Worldwide, fire disasters cause social, economic, and environmental damage, so their early detection and instant response is crucial for saving lives and property, which is possible via a soft computing approach. Researchers have therefore proposed different artificial intelligence-based approaches to detect fire at its early stages. However, several factors including domain shift problems, limited performance, and model complexity reduced their effectiveness in a real-world environment. To address these challenges, this study proposes an extensive data augmentation approach to tackle the domain shift problem by employing a mono-depth and atmospheric scattering model to generate and synthesise hazy, foggy, and night-time images. To further enhance the detection of small fire-affected areas, a refined DenseNet backbone is employed. This network is fine-tuned to extract intricate spatial details across different scales and establish meaningful connections between them. Subsequently, we introduce a soft attention mechanism into the backbone network. This entails utilising a 3D convolutional operation within the proposed attention framework to capture more extensive spatial features, which contributes to an enhanced discriminatory capability for detecting fire. Moreover, we have created a novel dataset explicitly designed for effective fire detection from a remote sensing perspective, known as the aerial drone and satellite fire (ADSF) dataset, encompasses images captured by drones and satellites. This broader range of image sources affords coverage across a wider expanse of geographical locations, surpassing the capabilities of CCTV cameras. Our proposed model achieves significant accuracy improvements, surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on both original and augmented datasets. For the Yar, FD, DFAN, and ADSF original datasets, we observed average accuracy increases of 1.25%, 1.95%, 2%, and 1.5%, respectively. In the comparisons with augmented versions of these datasets, our model consistently outperforms the SOTA, with accuracy improvements of 0.7, 1.97%, 1.42%, and 1.53%, respectively. Additionally, in our ablation studies, the proposed model excels in terms of both performance and resource efficiency. It achieves higher frame rates of 22.0, 72.5, and 7.0 FPS on CPU, GPU, and Raspberry Pi, respectively, with just 7.2 million learning parameters, making it well-suited for real-time deployment on edge devices. Finally, a Grad-CAM XAI method is utilised to visualise and highlight the most important regions in images emphasized by the model.

abstract = {During disaster management, unmanned aerial vehicles play an important role as they are deployed for effective search and rescue operations. Nowadays, personnel from many emergency services like police officers, firefighters, and volunteers in rescue teams take advantage of drones for cost-effective and time-efficient search and rescue operations. All drone-based search operations to date either have used vision-based drones or require direct human assistance along with the drone. During low or almost no visible light conditions, as well as in foggy weather, it becomes nearly impossible for vision-based drones to continue the search operation. Thus, we propose an alternative approach for drone-based search and rescue operations using acoustic source localization. During the search operation, the sound source is the victim, who is screaming for help. The signal emitted by the source will be recorded using an array of microphones embedded in the drone structure. Thus a novel approach is presented to analyze the captured audio signals for accurate source localization. The proposed method deals with the ego noise and wind noise generated by the motion of drone, its motors, propellers, and other stationary structural noise. A global-best guided cuckoo search optimization algorithm is used to estimate the noise components present in an unknown noisy signal. After estimation of noise either temporal subtraction is used in proposed Algorithm 1 or the Wiener filter as in proposed Algorithm 2 to suppress the noise. Afterward, the time difference of arrival-based sound source localization (SSL) is carried out to compute the coordinates of the speech source. The results demonstrated that Algorithms 1 and 2 both can localize the sound sources effectively whereas conventional SSL algorithms failed to produce the correct results. Further, Algorithm 2 outperforms Algorithm 1 in terms of accurate position estimation and signal-to-noise ratio improvement.}

abstract = {Recently, autonomous systems have received considerable attention amongst research communities and academicians. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) find useful in several applications like transportation, surveillance, disaster management, and wildlife monitoring. One of the important issues in the UAV system is energy efficiency, which can be resolved by the use of clustering approaches. In addition, high resolution remote sensing images need to be classified for effective decision making using deep learning (DL) models. Though several models are available in the literature, only few approaches have focused on the clustering and classification processes in UAV networks. In this aspect, this paper designs a novel metaheuristic with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system for decision making named MANFIS-DM technique on autonomous UAV systems. The proposed MANFIS-DM technique intends to effectively organize the UAV networks into clusters and then classify the images into appropriate class labels. The proposed MANFIS-DM technique encompasses two major stages namely quantum different evolution based clustering (QDE-C) technique and ANFIS based classification technique. Primarily, the QDE-C technique involves the design of a fitness function involving three parameters namely average distance, distance to UAVs, and UAV degree. Besides, the image classification model involves a set of subprocesses namely DenseNet based feature extraction, Adadelta based hyperparameter optimization, and ANFIS based classification. The design of QDE-C algorithm with classification model for autonomous UAV systems show the novelty of the work. The experimental result analysis of the MANFIS-DM method is carried out against benchmark dataset and the results ensured the enhanced performance of the MANFIS-DM technique over the other methods with the maximum accuy of 99.13%.}

The scientific promise of these data to expand our understanding of past human-environment interactions has not been fully realized. Limitations of data access, sufficient analytical and computational resources, and methodological awareness and education on the appropriate use of RSBD have limited the adoption and widespread use of RSBD in archaeology, despite its ubiquity in the Earth sciences. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a freely available planetary-scale cloud computing platform that addresses the perennial challenges of data access, analysis, and computing power that are particularly acute among archaeologists aiming to derive insights from RSBD. GEE lowers the barrier to entry for analyzing RSBD, expanding the potential for these data in the automated identification of archaeological features through deep learning; fieldwork planning and archaeological practice; modeling of past environments and environmental variability; and cultural heritage impact and risk assessments. In doing so, it also contributes to open science via increased access, transparency, and reproducibility.}

In particular, we investigate neural networks that map five key parameters in fire spread to the first arrival time, and the corresponding inverse problem. By using simulated data, we are able to characterize the error, the required dataset size, and the convergence properties of these neural networks. For the inverse problem, we quantify the network’s sensitivity in estimating each of the key parameters.

Therefore, there is a high probability that more people will be exposed to and endangered by forest fires. Hence there is an urgent need to design pervasive systems that effectively assist people and guide them to safety during wildfires. This paper examines the potential of mobile applications to be employed to assist people to escape wildfires in real-time, by means of using and evaluating EscapeWildFire, a system for suggesting evacuation paths to mobile phone users in real-time. Two different evaluation strategies are followed: (a) Considering different areas of the island of Cyprus as case studies with simulated wildfires and actual users and (b) Considering a historic wildfire that occurred in Amarillo, Texas in 2011. Results in both cases show that mobile apps can effectively be employed to assist people to escape wildfires, but their use is heavily dependent on a backend system that supports the precise modelling of the wildfire. The time between the wildfire outbreak and the notification reaching the user is crucial for their safety. Various recommendations for improvements have been recorded based on either the feedback of participants in the case studies or the observations from the Texas wildfire. The code of the mobile app, backend and administration interface used are all open-source; fire authorities around the world are encouraged to further investigate this opportunity and adopt this approach.}

This paper presents a framework for the development and implementation of incident-level wildfire impact assessment of WUI residential structures including the following successive components: hazard, inventory, exposure, and impact. The hazard model generates spatial and temporal distribution of fire intensity for wildfire event scenarios; the inventory model provides spatial pattern of exposed structures; the exposure model estimates the fire intensity at WUI locations; whereas the impact model evaluates the structures loss by applying newly developed empirical response functions represented as the relationship between fire intensity, distance from forest edge and expected proportion of burned structures. A case study application of the proposed framework is presented for loss assessment of structures in a WUI community of the northern boreal forest of Canada. The proposed framework is particularly useful to the public safety community for conducting what-if scenarios of wildfire impact in support of emergency and mitigation planning.}

Accurate assessments in this context are critical for post-event search-and-rescue (SAR) operations and resource distribution. Recent computing advancements are revealing the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in collecting data and assisting with post-hurricane reconnaissance. However, the use of AI and UAV photogrammetry for accurate disaster impact analysis remains underexplored. To this end, this study proposes a damage and debris analysis framework harnessing reality capture through aerial imagery and photogrammetry. Within this framework, a region-based neural network is leveraged to detect debris locations in aerial imagery with favorable performance. In a testbed within the Beaumont-Port Arthur region, in Southeast Texas, this study performs 3D reality captures of the built environment. Since the accuracy of the 3D reality capture is of importance in research areas associated with time-sensitive disaster response, we further investigate the optimal 2D aerial imagery overlap ratio required to generate a sufficiently accurate 3D model for disaster impact analysis and debris volume estimation. Results indicate that, in the case of aerial imagery for infrastructure systems, a minimum of 60 % overlap is recommended for damage assessment and debris analysis. In contrast, for flat green areas, a minimum of 50 % overlap is adequate. Overall, for disaster response applications, our study reveals that an overlap ratio between 60 % and 70 % is optimal for achieving a balance between time efficiency and data quality in aerial data collection. These quantitative recommendations are crucial for enabling efficient disaster response efforts. Additionally, our study outcomes will improve disaster impact analysis and facilitating timely and effective response strategies.}

This study explores current achievements, existing challenges, and the untapped potential of DT in disaster risk management, and accordingly, proposes an improved Digital twin-based post-disaster risk management framework. This paper employs a systematic literature review approach focusing on digital post-disaster risk management twinning (DPRMT) and smart early warning systems derived from two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. After a screening process with exclusion criteria, the final analysis synthesizes findings from a selected set of 96 papers. The results revealed that previous studies are not beyond only providing general statements about DT. There is a need for diverse data collection methods, considering demographic and financial aspects, understanding social dynamics, employing dynamic models, recognizing interconnected systems, and giving due attention to the often-neglected recovery phase. This study proposes a comprehensive DPRMT concept framework leveraging decision-makers with a holistic and efficient approach that offers real-time, detailed, and data-driven modeling solutions to achieve insights into disaster-affected areas and communities. It is also helpful to optimize response planning, resource allocation, and scenario testing by capturing the dynamic and complex human behaviors and understanding interconnected systems and entities that are often overlooked in previous disaster risk management studies.}

abstract = {Fire managers seek accurate methods to map fire severity for forest management efforts. Fire severity data with wide spatial and temporal coverage enhances understanding of fire's impact on vegetation and improves planning to mitigate the risk of destructive wildfires. In this study, we develop a machine learning workflow that converts a spatial database of known fire events into a collection of gridded fire severity maps representing levels of canopy scorch due to wildfires and planned fuel reduction burns (prescribed burns). This workflow uses a dataset of observed fire severity interpreted from post-fire aerial images (3–7 cm spatial resolution; ~11,649 labels from 64 unique fires) to train and test a supervised classifier that predicts fire severity using 13 Landsat-derived spectral indices. For a target fire, the classifier generates a pixel-level prediction of fire severity with classes belonging to one of five ordinal categories ranging from unburnt, three levels of canopy scorch, and canopy consumed by fire. The classifier's accuracy was 84.2% (Kappa score = 0.799) and testing was undertaken across multiple fire types (wildfire / prescribed burn), seasons, forest types and topography. MODIS thermal anomalies and a MODIS-derived burn area product were used to augment the fire severity database with start- and end-of-fire dates to enable accurate delineation of pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery; this method increased model accuracy from 78.0% (Kappa = 0.72). The model was then applied to a regional 16-year (2005 to 2020) history of fire events (n fires = 713, ~1Mha) in the sclerophyll eucalypt forests and woodlands of the Northern Jarrah Forest, Western Australia. On fires with MODIS-adjusted start and end dates, high severity fire (>80% canopy scorch) was predicted more often in wildfires (67.9%, 124900 ha) compared to prescribed burns (14.6%, 110300 ha). However, the total predicted area of high-severity fire was comparable between fire types due to prescribed burns being more frequent on the landscape. We provide the first fire severity model in Western Australia that is broadly calibrated to both prescribed burns and wildfires across multiple conditions. Our model outputs are made freely available and offer opportunities to better understand the interactions between prescribed burns and wildfires, and the effects of fire severity on the environment.}

abstract = {Fire detection is crucial in the protection of human life and property. Traditional methodologies and deep learning techniques have been extensively employed in this area, yet they often fall short due to the considerable variability in the shape, size, and intensity of flames. Conventional approaches lean on predefined fire characteristics, failing to adapt sufficiently across a broad spectrum of fire conditions. Simultaneously, deep learning techniques may struggle with managing diverse and unusual flame attributes. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that synergizes traditional methods with deep learning techniques—the Fire Segmentation-Detection Framework (FSDF). FSDF enhances flame feature detection by extracting color and texture information from images, utilizing Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV), and the Complete Local Binary Pattern (CLBP). In addition, we weave YOLOv8 and Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) into the fabric of our framework to facilitate image segmentation and carry out unsupervised fire detection, respectively. To gauge the accuracy and robustness of our proposed method, we implemented a comprehensive assessment using a dataset constructed from real-world forest and urban fires. Experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the competitive edge of our approach over some baseline methods. For instance, in contrast to YOLOv8, our framework has bolstered precision, recall, and F-score by 19.5%, 1.2%, and 11.7% respectively. Finally, we conducted extensive field tests by deploying a robot with the relevant algorithm in an actual fire scenario, further emphasizing our dedication to real-world application. These experiments underline not only the performance of the method, but also its potential for practical deployment.}

The proposed work is an amalgam of computer vision, deep learning, and Internet of Things and aims to inculcate the positives of each of these technologies. To the best of our knowledge, a combination of the said technologies has never been used for insurance fraud analyses in the field of agriculture, making this a novel approach. The proposed model actively reads the input from the IR and temperature sensors of the IoT device, which further collects images of the field once the sensor values cross their respective thresholds. The collected images are then fed into a fire detection model trained using a variety of classifiers for performance comparisons. The results display that the proposed solution has an accuracy of 97%, which can be further increased with a refined dataset dedicated solely to fraud detection.}

To expedite data assimilation, the wildfire perimeter is represented by a two-dimensional polyline simplification algorithm. In addition, to facilitate the data assimilation, a new process is developed to relate the prediction results with the actual observation data. The proposed method is tested and demonstrated by an example wildfire spread scenario generated based on actual climate, topography, and vegetation. The results confirm that the polyline simplification algorithm can drastically reduce the computational time required for data assimilation while maintaining the accuracy of predictions. The proposed method is expected to serve as a core algorithm for near-real-time prediction and data-driven updating of wildfire spread.}

Cultural properties should be preserved because they reflect the local characteristics and knowledge of their creators. Therefore, damaged cultural properties, which are difficult to restore, should be among the first considerations in a disaster situation. In this paper, we propose a method for using geospatial information to promote cultural heritage resilience with respect to disasters. Images from satellites, drones, and terrestrial sensors are available in various forms and provide various types of information. The acquired data can be formed into a digital cultural heritage cube, which enables timely access to any desired data. Additional information can be derived from the accumulated data through image fusion processes and the ancestors’ knowledge encapsulated in cultural properties. To verify this, we explored two disasters—arson and forest fires—in Korea. We concluded that, if the proposed method is applied to cultural properties, the damage to culture assets can be minimised and their resilience can be enhanced.}

This paper has twofold objective: (1) show how CFD simulation carried out using fully-physical models contributes to the understanding of wildfire behaviour, and (2) present new developments that were brought to FireStar3D – a fully-physical multiphase fire-simulator. The multiphase approach used in this class of models is briefly described, as well as the difficulties arising from the coupling between the various physical mechanisms of this multiscale problem. LES modelling and turbulence-radiation interaction used in FireStar3D is particularly detailed, as well as a new inlet boundary condition allowing to account for fire-induced flow while maintaining a prevailing crosswind far from the flaming zone. The benefits of multiphase CFD approach in addressing wildfire problems is demonstrated by considering three case studies of static and propagating vegetation fires having different length scales, which also highlights the model's potential in various configurations.}

Current road safety management systems rely heavily on manual data collection, visual inspection and subjective expert judgment for their effectiveness, which is costly, time-consuming, and sometimes ineffective due to under-reporting and the poor quality of the data. A range of innovations offers the potential to provide more comprehensive and effective data collection and analysis to improve road safety. However, there has been no systematic analysis of this evidence base. To this end, this paper provides a systematic review of the state of the art. It identifies that digital technologies - Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine-Learning, Image-Processing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Smartphone applications, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), Drones, Social Media, Virtual-reality, Simulator, Radar, Sensor, Big Data – provide useful means for identifying and providing information on road safety factors including road user behaviour, road characteristics and operational environment. Moreover, the results show that digital technologies such as AI, Image processing and IoT have been widely applied to enhance road safety, due to their ability to automatically capture and analyse data while preventing the possibility of human error. However, a key gap in the literature remains their effectiveness in real-world environments. This limits their potential to be utilised by policymakers and practitioners.}

UAVs can be used in commercial applications, such as goods delivery, as well as in military surveillance. They can also operate in civil domains like search-and-rescue missions, that require multiple UAVs to collect location data as well as transmit video streams. However, the malicious use of UAVs began to emerge in recent years. The frequency of such attacks has been significantly increasing and their impact can have devastating effects. Hence, the relevant industries and standardisation bodies are exploring possibilities for securing UAV systems and networks. Our survey focuses on UAV security and privacy issues whilst establishing flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) as well as on threats to the Internet of drones (IoD) infrastructure used to provide control and access over the Internet between UAVs and users. The goal of this survey is to categorise the versatile aspects of the UAV threat landscape and develop a classification approach based on different types of connections and nodes in FANETs and IoD. In particular, we categorise security and privacy threats on connections between UAVs, ground control stations, and personal pilot devices. All the most relevant threats and their corresponding defence mechanisms are classified using characteristics of the first four layers of the OSI model. We then analyse the conventional and novel UAV routing protocols, indicating their advantages and disadvantages from the cyber security perspective. To provide a deeper insight, the reviewed defence mechanisms have undergone a thorough examination of their security requirements and objectives such as availability, authentication, authorisation, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, and non-repudiation. Finally, we discuss the open research challenges, the limitations of current UAV standards, and provide possible future directions for research.}

Many forecasting techniques predict fire activity and allocate prevention resources, but various factors are missing from the assessments, and multi-criteria decision approaches alone are insufficient. This work introduced a novel methodology combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP multi-criteria methods, and spatial data to detect potential forest fire vulnerability areas using twenty variables. The results from AHP or fuzzy AHP, were processed using a multilayer perceptron with a backpropagation algorithm. The final ANN model has two objectives: first, to create a forest fire vulnerability with four classes (low, moderate, high, and very high), and second, to classify burned area sizes in regions highly or very highly vulnerable to fire. Evaluation metrics were also applied for validation. The fire model was tested using both literature review data and in situ observations. Comparative analysis showed that the burned area size model performed better than other machine learning methods, achieving an accuracy score of 89%. Meanwhile, the fire vulnerability model scored 82%. The study addresses the problem of prediction and provides an algorithm for classifying fire risk based on historical data in the Czech Republic, offering a master model for future forest management. Therefore, the ANN model, once trained, validated, and tested, does not require resetting and is effective for estimating forest fire vulnerability. Moreover, it produces results quickly, providing rapid insights into complex forest ecosystems, saving time and enhancing understanding for decision-makers.}

abstract = {Savannas, complex ecosystems characterized by an intricate blend of grasslands and woodlands, span vast portions of the global terrestrial landscape. These ecosystems not only serve as biodiversity hotspots but also support vast human populations and play a significant role in the Earth's carbon cycle. In this chapter, we embarked on an in-depth exploration of the distinctiveness of savannas, emphasizing their spatial heterogeneity, ranging from open grasslands to dense woodlands, and the complex temporal fluctuations dictated by seasonal shifts, fire regimes, and longer-term changes instigated by broader climatic shifts. Remote sensing emerges as a promising tool for studying these landscapes, given its ability to offer large-scale, repetitive, and detailed observations. However, it is not without challenges. We dissected the difficulties of interpreting mixed pixels, navigating rapid seasonal transitions in vegetation that sometimes surpass satellite revisit intervals, detecting and differentiating burn scars post-fire, and contending with atmospheric interferences like frequent cloud cover, particularly pronounced in tropical savannas. This chapter also underscores the innovations in technology and methodology that provide avenues to circumvent these challenges. Multi-sensor approaches amalgamate data from various sensors to refine vegetation characterization. Advanced machine learning and AI-driven algorithms are emerging as pivotal approaches, aiding in sophisticated image processing, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. But even in this age of GeoAI, the importance of ground-truthing remains paramount. In-situ observations and measurements fortify the credibility of remote sensing data, anchoring them in tangible, on-the-ground realities. While the present offers a gamut of tools and methodologies to study savannas, the future is even more promising. It beckons with the possibility of seamlessly integrated multi-sensor systems, more advanced AI models tailored for savanna studies, and a deeper symbiosis between technology and traditional field surveys. As we stand on this cusp, it is imperative to remember that understanding and preserving savannas is not just an academic pursuit; it is a commitment to our planet's ecological richness and resilience.}

abstract = {Disasters can have devastating impacts on communities and economies, underscoring the urgent need for effective strategic disaster risk management (DRM). Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to enhance DRM through improved decision-making processes, its inherent complexity and "black box" nature have led to a growing demand for Explainable AI (XAI) techniques. These techniques facilitate the interpretation and understanding of decisions made by AI models, promoting transparency and trust. However, the current state of XAI applications in DRM, their achievements, and the challenges they face remain underexplored. In this systematic literature review, we delve into the burgeoning domain of XAI-DRM, extracting 195 publications from the Scopus and ISI Web of Knowledge databases, and selecting 68 for detailed analysis based on predefined exclusion criteria. Our study addresses pertinent research questions, identifies various hazard and disaster types, risk components, and AI and XAI methods, uncovers the inherent challenges and limitations of these approaches, and provides synthesized insights to enhance their explainability and effectiveness in disaster decision-making. Notably, we observed a significant increase in the use of XAI techniques for DRM in 2022 and 2023, emphasizing the growing need for transparency and interpretability. Through a rigorous methodology, we offer key research directions that can serve as a guide for future studies. Our recommendations highlight the importance of multi-hazard risk analysis, the integration of XAI in early warning systems and digital twins, and the incorporation of causal inference methods to enhance DRM strategy planning and effectiveness. This study serves as a beacon for researchers and practitioners alike, illuminating the intricate interplay between XAI and DRM, and revealing the profound potential of AI solutions in revolutionizing disaster risk management.}

abstract = {Currently, there is an increasing pressure to decarbonize and meet energy demands. In this regard, the usage of renewable energy sources is becoming more prominent. Biomass energy can significantly contribute to this effort. However, due to logistical costs, its exploitation is often considered less ‘desirable.’ Sometimes, particularly in the context of residual biomass, open burning on site is desirable. This study aims to optimize the residual biomass supply chain by leveraging digitalization's advantages, thereby creating a new model for this purpose. Methodologically, this research initially adopted an empirical approach, analyzing documents from a project that recreated the current scenario. In its second phase, the study involved a literature review to gather insights needed for developing the final model. Consequently, this study offers three major contributions: a detailed mapping of the current scenario, a comprehensive synthesis of the potentials of emerging technologies in the supply chain, and a model illustrating the integration of these technologies in the context of residual biomass. Thus, this research presents an opportunity to transform a common ‘leftover’ into a value-added material. To better assess the model's value, two analyses, PEST and SWOT, were conducted to align the conceptual proposal with real-world contexts.}

The level of accuracy in UAV-supported measurement data has been increasing in the field of forestry. Recently, biophysical and morphological tree information has been calculated using the three-dimensional (3D) point cloud data. The accuracy of studies on different types of trees (i.e. coniferous and deciduous) may vary depending on the selected instruments and methods. Within the scope of the present study, height (H) and crown projection area (CPA) of 105 stone pines (Pinus pinea, L.) measured using both conventional methods and UAV-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) derived 3D dense point cloud were evaluated. Tree volumes in the study area were calculated using the allometric formulas generated based on the linear diameter model produced with the field measurements. For field measurements and UAV based data, the tree volumes were calculated using the single- and double-entry over-bark stem volume equations, and their numerical comparisons were conducted. To search for the differences, RMSE (Root mean square error), RMSE% (Root mean square percentage error), MAE (Mean absolute error) and MAE% (Mean absolute percentage error) values were taken into consideration. According to the results of the paired t-test, it was revealed that there were no significant differences between the field- and SfM- measurements based methods. Considering the average values instead of individual (single) trees in the information obtained using the 3D point cloud in such stands gave more accurate results. It was found that forest parameters at plot levels in stands could be quickly revealed by UAV photogrammetry. In addition, these data can be evaluated as a metric measurement technique for sustainable and precise operational planning in forest lands.}

We analysed the dry season wildfire occurrences in the Mediterranean region of Central Chile (32°S–39°30′ S) between 2000 and 2017, using satellite images to detect burned areas, their landscape metrics and the land use and covers (vegetal) pre-wildfire, in order to determine the population living in areas that may be affected by wildfires. The existing regulations in western Mediterranean countries (Portugal, Spain, France, and Italy) were used to identify and define the wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas, quantifying the people inhabiting them and estimating the population affected by burned areas from 2001 to 2017. We used the Google Earth Engine to process MODIS products and extract both burned areas and land covers. We detected that 25% of the urban population inhabits WUI areas (i.e. Biobío, Araucanía and Valparaíso regions) where the urban population exposed to burned areas exceeds 40%. Most of the land use and land covers affected by wildfires are anthropogenic land covers, classified as savannas, croplands, evergreen broadleaf forests and woody savannas, representing >70% of the burned areas. Urban areas show only 0.6% of the burned surface from 2001 to 2017. We estimate that 55,680 people are potentially affected by wildfires, and 50% of them are in just one administrative region. These results show the imperative need for public policies as a regulating force for establishing WUI areas with the purpose of identifying wildfire risk in urban areas, such as establishing prevention methods as firewalls and prescribed fires.}

abstract = {Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) have particular importance in various military and civilian applications due to their specific features, including frequent topological changes, the movement of drones in a three-dimensional space, and their restricted energy. These features have created challenges for designing cluster-based routing protocols. In this paper, a Q-learning-based smart clustering routing method (QSCR) is suggested in FANETs. In QSCR, each node discovers its neighbors through the periodic exchange of hello messages. The hello time interval is different in each cluster, and cluster leaders determine this interval based on the average speed similarity. Next, an adaptive clustering process is presented for categorizing drones in the clusters. In this step, the cluster leader is selected based on a new parameter called merit value, which includes residual energy, centrality, neighbor degree, speed similarity, and link validity time. Then, a centralized Q-learning model is presented to tune weight coefficients related to merit parameters dynamically. In the last step, the routing process is done using a greedy forwarding technique. Finally, QSCR is run on NS2, and the simulation results of QSCR are compared with those of ICRA, WCA, and DCA. These results show that QSCR carries out the clustering process rapidly but has less cluster stability than ICRA. QSCR gets energy efficiency and improves network lifetime. In the routing process, QSCR has a high packet delivery rate compared to other schemes. Also, the number of isolated clusters created in QSCR is less than other clustering methods. However, the proposed scheme has a higher end-to-end delay than ICRA. Also, this scheme experiences more communication overhead than ICRA slightly.}

Nowadays we observe and model the Earth with a wealth of observations, from a plethora of different sensors, measuring states, fluxes, processes and variables, at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. Earth observation is well equipped with remote sensing systems, mounted on satellites and airborne platforms, but it also involves in-situ observations, numerical models and social media data streams, among other data sources. Data-driven approaches, and ML techniques in particular, are the natural choice to extract significant information from this data deluge. This paper produces a thorough review of the latest work on information fusion for Earth observation, with a practical intention, not only focusing on describing the most relevant previous works in the field, but also the most important Earth observation applications where ML information fusion has obtained significant results. We also review some of the most currently used data sets, models and sources for Earth observation problems, describing their importance and how to obtain the data when needed. Finally, we illustrate the application of ML data fusion with a representative set of case studies, as well as we discuss and outlook the near future of the field.}

Preventing illegal deforestation activities is an emergent and crucial mission for the world. Recently, automated monitoring systems using Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) appear as a promising solution to combat deforestation. However, the quality design of such systems considering the deforestation prevention impacts remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose a socio-ICT (Information Communication Technology) model that enables to analyze the deforestation prevention impacts of a UAV-based monitoring system quantitatively. The socio-ICT model uses a causal loop diagram to formulate the relations among system quality measures and key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with deforestation prevention. Through the numerical study, we estimate the effectiveness of the UAV monitoring system by annual deforestation rate and CO2 gas emissions. Our analysis shows important design trade-offs need to be considered when planning UAV-based monitoring systems.}

In addition, software, and hardware complexity in UAVs also triggers privacy and security issues as well as causes critical challenges for government, industry and academia. Firstly, in this research review, we broadly survey privacy and security issues of UAVs by dividing them into three classes: Software, Hardware and Communication. Particularly, for each class, we systematically survey the common vulnerabilities causing potential attacks to UAVs. Secondly, a review of prevailing threats that are threatening civilian UAVs’ applications is also a part of this survey. Thirdly, a comprehensive discussion of passive and active attacks from adversaries, for compromising privacy and security of UAVs is given as well. Fourthly, we provide detail description of existing mitigation techniques and countermeasures, to protect UAVs. Fifthly, the solution architecture part includes discussion about emerging technologies such as, blockchain usage, machine learning, intrusion detection systems and secure communication protocols. To store all data in transit, blockchain can be used cryptographically and protect it from eavesdropping and tampering. In this research review, key points that highlighted the lessons learned about security and privacy of UAVs are also summarized. Lastly, the survey is concluded by discussing important pitfalls as well as suggestions for future research directions, concerning privacy and security of UAVs.}
