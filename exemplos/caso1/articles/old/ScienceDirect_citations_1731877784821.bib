abstract = {Large-scale fires in urban areas have highlighted the need to develop ways of assessing the risks posed by smoke plumes to people and the environment. One of the challenges is to quickly provide the authorities with information on the areas affected by the plume and the levels of pollutant concentration to which people may have been exposed. In this work, we develop an inverse modelling method to find the smoke source term of a large-scale fire by assimilating in-situ pollutant concentration measurements. A Bayesian method based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is considered to determine the source characteristics and their uncertainties. The source is described by a time-varying emission rate and an emission height. The latter, linked to the phenomenon of plume rise, is an important parameter for assessing the pollution impact in the vicinity of the fire. An inversion proposal that forces the system to choose a single emission height is introduced. These inverse methodologies are applied to the real case study of a major warehouse fire in Aubervilliers, near Paris, in 2021. In most cases of application, certain information, such as the pollution already present before the fire, may be difficult to estimate, particularly in an operational situation. Fine-tuning of the inverse method to make it more robust for transposition to future case studies are then discussed.}

Undoubtedly, human society is called to adapt to these changes in a sustainable way that covers the human needs for water and at the same time secures ecological requirements for the environment. In practice, water managers face the challenge of balancing human and ecological water requirements under the setting of global change that involves large environmental and socioeconomical changes. To this end, river scientists are using the concept of environmental flows (e-flows) to define the quantity of water that is required for freshwater ecosystems to maintain their function and structure and deliver the water-related services to human societies. Although certain advancements in e-flow science have been made, scientists and water managers have acknowledged that several gaps and issues remain, particularly when it comes to the practical implementation of the e-flows for an integrated water management approach. This chapter, with the aid of a scoping review, explores trends in the research related with the allocation of water resources according to human and ecological requirements and attempts to address major challenges that any future assessment scheme will have to face. In a way it examines the progress in the topic of e-flows during the last few years with emphasis placed on whether scientists address well-known issues and concerns. The findings of the review confirm that several issues persist as most of the reviewed studies are limited to a small spatial scale, disregard the ecohydrological relationships and do not take into consideration the implications caused by future environmental and socioeconomic change. The need to make progress and overcome these issues is highlighted and the emerging research opportunities are discussed. New research may focus on key aspects of e-flows such as the development of new sophisticated ecohydrological models that accurately predict ecosystem functions to flow alterations, the ability to discriminate the effects of flow alterations from other coacting stressors, and the quantification of the impact of flow alteration on the delivered ecosystem services. Broadening the perspective of e-flows will contribute to integrated catchment management to embed more realistic definitions of the minimum ecological water requirements.}

abstract = {Hollows in standing trees are an important ecological resource for many Australian vertebrates, including a range of threatened mammals, reptiles and birds. However, the ecology of tree hollows, and the extent to which they support hollow-dependent fauna, has been severely under-studied in northern Australia. This study evaluated the reliability of ground-based surveys of tree hollows in a northern Australian eucalypt savanna. We counted hollows in trees using two approaches: (1) ground-based surveys and (2) climbing surveys, i.e. double sampling. Assuming that climbing surveys are accurate, ground-based surveys tended to overestimate hollow density (per tree) by around 15%. However, of the hollows counted in the climbing surveys (n = 202), 44.5% were blocked by hard termitaria. Once unavailable (blocked) hollows were accounted for, ground-based surveys tended to overestimate available hollow density (per tree) by 59%. According to generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), a hollow was more likely to be blocked if it had a smaller entrance diameter, occurred on a tree with a termite mound at its base and smaller DBH. We calibrated site-level ground-based counts using GLMMs of climbing counts and available climbing counts as a function of ground-based counts for double-sampled trees. Overall, our uncalibrated counts resulted in over-reporting of mean site-based density of available hollows by 38%. The discrepancy between densities of total hollows and available hollows has important implications for the conservation of many threatened and declining species known to rely on tree hollows in northern Australia. We suggest that when conducting ground-based hollow surveys to assess tree hollow availability in northern Australia, a subsample of trees should be double-sampled, i.e. both ground-based and climbing counts, to account for survey error due to the blocking of hollows by termitaria.}

Due to the growing global population and urbanization, these soils are increasingly used to provide food, feed, fiber, energy, and other services to our society. In this paper, we summarize some recent studies on sandy soils and review the main soil and environmental issues related to the understanding, use, and management. We classify the soil issues into three categories: 1) physical and hydrological, 2) chemical and agronomical, and 3) biological and ecological issues. Recent advances include developing models and methods characterizing soil water repellency, preferential flows, transport of nutrients, agrochemicals and industrial contaminants, and groundwater contamination, soil compaction, erosion and evapotranspiration, improving soil fertility, structure, and biodiversity, monitoring, mapping, and managing salinity, sodicity, carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emission, and heavy metal contamination. The main challenges are to understand changes in sandy soil conditions (e.g. soil water repellency, soil compaction, crust, erosion, salinization, structure, fertility, inorganic and organic contamination) and processes (e.g. evapotranspiration, carbon sequestration, nutrients leaching and cycling, greenhouse gas emission) under intensive agricultural activities and climate change and evaluate the impacts of soil texture on soil properties and processes. A conceptual framework is proposed for holistic understanding and management of sandy soils under changing climate conditions and agricultural activities.}

abstract = {Alteration to the sediment supply of fluvial channels is well understood to trigger morphological adjustment, but the particularities and peculiarities that arise in any specific situation – the magnitude and direction of change that occurs in response to a given sediment supply modification – have long complicated broad conceptualizations of channel evolution. Because many projected changes due both to climate and human actions stand to increase sediment supplied to world rivers, it is imperative that our understanding of river response to influxes of sediment be comprehensive, underpinned by sound theory and augmented by empirical observations. To that end, here we review the literature concerning the geomorphic response of low-gradient, braided and meandering alluvial river channels to increases in sediment supply. We define such rivers as those with a gradient <0.002 that flow within a self-formed floodplain and are semi-confined or unconfined in terms of capacity for lateral adjustment. The intent of this review is both to provide managers, practitioners, and scientists with a readily referenceable summary of changes observed in a multitude of settings and to create an empirically supported conceptual framework that can be used in concert with existing models to contextualize and anticipate geomorphic response to a sediment influx. Upon analysis, several ideas emerge from the literature. First, channel adjustment following a sediment supply increase occurs across a series of nested response scales, which are separated by thresholds defined by aspects of the sediment influx. Second, the crossing of these thresholds is primarily a function of the influx grain size distribution and volume relative to the antecedent bed grain size and sediment load. Third, we term these thresholds, which represent the sediment input parameters necessary to drive change to occur at successively larger scales, influx effectiveness thresholds. Last, future work must focus on further quantification of these thresholds by explicit measurement of various metrics, including influx volumes and characteristics and antecedent sediment loads and parameters, and examination of additional controlling factors such as system trajectory and biotic influences. The synthesis and framework presented here should ideally assist in enhanced understanding and improved prediction of geomorphic adjustment following a sediment supply increase as well as steer future studies towards thorough investigations of the various dynamics necessary to further increase our knowledge of channel response(s) to changing sediment inputs.}

The climate change induces both abiotic and biotic environmental stressors. Investigation of the impact of biotic and abiotic environmental stressors at the organismal levels to decipher their interactions influencing the biodiversity of species is often prohibitively expensive and labor intensive. However, functional eDNA genomics allows the simultaneous monitoring of biodiversity of organisms and assessment of exposome, pointing critical information about the complex biotic interactions related to climate change impacting ecosystems. Both liquid and solid wastes generated from human activities contain degradable and nondegradable contaminants, including heavy metals, inorganic and organic hydrocarbons, lignocellulose, plastics, bricks, inert materials, and others. The waste exposed to both abiotic and biotic factors is degraded and transformed either into nontoxic organic compounds, which can be converted into value-added products by bioprocessing, or more toxic compounds including dangerous stressors or evolution of multidrug-resistant microorganisms. Here we extend our efforts to describe the potential of eDNA as an innovative emerging tool for monitoring biodiversity and exposomics. Additionally, we discuss the need for the identification and genomic mining of novel degradation genes, its activity in the biodegradation of persistent existing environmental and emerging contaminants, and assessing ecological and human health using eDNA. In summary, the application of eDNA for environmental biomonitoring has the potential to provide a breakthrough in the field of exposomics and climate impact modeling together with biofuel and biomaterials from the changing biodiversity.}

abstract = {Worldwide, agriculture and farming systems intrinsically depend on climate but have dramatically changed due to technological progress and expansion, socioeconomic development, shifts in consumption patterns, and the threat of environmental degradation. Almost half of the Earth's farmable land has been converted to croplands, pastures, and rangelands. On the other side, farmers and land managers have affected the agricultural ecosystems through extracting farming and abusive use of resources to increase food production to satisfy either local consumption or trade. Nearly one in three people in the world (2.37 billion) did not have access to adequate food in 2020 an increase of almost 320 million people in just 1year. Consequently, food and nutrition insecurity and climate change emerged as the most pressing and urgent challenges for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the ideals of Agenda 2063. Presently, both developed and developing nations are facing urgent and interconnected challenges that are mining hope for securing food for the growing population and restoring the environment and natural resources. In other terms, less than 10 years into the 2030 Agenda, SDG two is still far from being reached by most countries. A profound understanding of this complexity is fundamental for transitioning to and hence building sustainable food and farming systems. Actions of transformation set the overarching objectives of mobilizing all actors toward zero hunger and net-zero emissions by 2050at the latest. Sustainable agriculture in its various streams, management practices and values, is an essential shift to satisfy the growing population and for tackling these land challenges. Sustainability initiatives are requested to tackle multiple challenges and drivers of agriculture and to provide rollover benefits from both short and long-term solutions to merge toward healthy food systems. From the available experiences and studies, conservation, regenerative, organic, and precision agriculture are the leading processes and game changers being used to help the agriculture sector to reverse the effects of climate change and address other disruptors to the total food supply chain. Such types of agriculture are mainstreaming healthy and durable food systems and revolutionizing farming worldwide. In other terms, these innovative and win-win-win solutions value the health of soils, people, and ecosystems. The SDGs-relating to food, natural resources management, and climate change will or can be attainable if common engagement, globally and locally, of the champions of essential streams of sustainable agriculture, is implemented and enforced in terms of policy, capacity development, technology, institutional settings, and availability of durable funds. Shifting to healthy and plant-based diets and a circular economy could further haste advancement toward regenerative and nutrition-sensitive agriculture and environmental sustainability.}

This paper proposes a developmental approach to evolving collective behaviours whereby the evolutionary process is guided by a novel value system. A self-organising map is used at the core of this value system and motion properties of the swarm entities are used as input. Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.}

abstract = {Recently, the air-quality monitoring system using microsensors have been widely used in various environments, from urban and polluted areas to clean areas (i.e., rural) and from ground-based stations to high altitude. Several methods of calibration in the laboratory for microsensors have been introduced, and some field observations under ambient atmosphere, indoor, or personal exposure have been tested. Vast numbers of those sensors can be deployed simultaneously in different locations to get the spatiotemporal resolution of air-quality data in real-time and online. Good agreement between the low-to-medium resolution of particulate sensors and the medium-to-high class of related instruments has been found. Furthermore, low sensitivity of gas sensors can still be sensing the fluctuation of gas concentrations in the air. This means that microsensors can be used to fill the gap of air-quality data for a better understanding of our environment. However, air-quality data from microsensors does not comply with current regulations. Therefore, preparing a good sampling line, as well as the measurement chamber, and avoid direct emissions or humid conditions, will make the air-quality data is still valid (with statistical errors). In this chapter, we discussed the features and trends of microsensors for air-quality measurements and the utilization of these sensors for long-term monitoring of air pollution. Laboratory-checked methods for the sensors and its field observation are discussed along with the technical issues of these sensors.}

abstract = {Unmanned vehicles have been widely used for sensing, surveillance, surveying, communication, transportation, and many other purposes. Navigation is always an essential operational function in the course of their movements. In the case of the absence of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, the positioning need of an unmanned vehicle is generally empowered by its onboard Inertial Navigation System (INS). An inherent deficiency of INS, however, is that position errors inevitably occur and will gradually accumulate over time. A feasible approach to correcting errors is to use the fixed reference points with known coordinates in the cruising environment, which we call landmarks, to calibrate the vehicle’s position when it passes by. The vehicle must choose a path along which a sufficient number of landmarks can serve the position calibration requirement. In such a context, this paper introduces a joint landmark selection and path planning problem for unmanned vehicles navigating in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments, in which the vehicles’ position drifting errors need to be rectified through communicating with preset landmarks. To characterize and tackle the problem, a set of new types of subpaths are defined and a bi-objective integer programming model using this building block is formulated for simultaneously minimizing the landmark deployment cost and the vehicle cruise distance. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm, which features a multi-criterion label-correcting form, is developed for searching for the Pareto-optimal solution set of landmark and path selections. Numerical and computational analyses are conducted in both 2D and 3D scenarios, in which a pair of origin and destination places are typically hundreds of kilometers apart and 4 datasets of different scales including 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 candidate landmarks are randomly generated. A sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of different position drifting increments caused by external environment interferences, varying correction abilities, and heterogeneous landmark deployment costs on the solution behavior. The influence of the number of candidate landmarks, position error limit, and error increment rate on computing time is also evaluated. All these test results conclude that the algorithm is capable of finding in seconds the entire set of Pareto-optimal landmarks and paths in real-world applications.}

While significant efforts have been carried out to examine the relationships between urban forms and tsunami evacuation, challenges remain on delivering evidence-based urban design strategies, principles or metrics that could be applied by decision-makers to guide the physical development or retrofitting of tsunami-prone coastal communities around the world. In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines tsunami flood and evacuation modelling with statistical analysis, to examine the pedestrian evacuation potential of 67 urban samples extracted from 12 case studies in Chile. Our findings show that urban form parameters like the number of exit points out of an endangered area, the mean distance from the street network to these points, and the population density, can have a noticeable impact on tsunami evacuation times, which nonetheless is significantly dependent on the evacuees’ departure time. Moreover, we demonstrate that Chilean urban coastal development has been noticeably carried out through grid-like form patterns that might contribute to hinder evacuation in case of a tsunami emergency.}

abstract = {Land surface albedo plays an important role in controlling the surface energy budget and regulating the biophysical processes of natural dynamics and anthropogenic activities. Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach to estimate surface albedo at regional and global scales. It nevertheless remains challenging for current satellites to capture fine-scale albedo variations due to their coarse spatial resolutions from tens to hundreds of meters. The emerging Sentinel-2 satellites, with a high spatial resolution of 10 m and an approximate 5-day revisiting cycle, provide a promising solution to address these observational limitations, yet their potentials remain underexplored. In this study, we integrated the Sentinel-2 observations with an updated direct estimation approach to improve the estimation and monitoring of fine-scale surface albedo. To enable the capability of the direct estimation approach at a 10-m scale, we combined the 10-m resolution European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover land cover data and the 500-m resolution Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo product to build a high-quality and representative BRDF training database. To evaluate our approach, we proposed an integrated evaluation framework leveraging 3-D physical model simulations, ground measurements, and satellite observations. Specifically, we first simulated a comprehensive dataset of Sentinel-2-like surface reflectance and broadband albedo across a variety of geometric configurations using the MODIS BRDF training samples. With this dataset, we built the Look-Up-Tables (LUTs) that connect surface broadband albedo and Sentinel-2 reflectance through a direct angular bin-based linear regression approach, and further coupled these LUTs with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform. We next evaluated the proposed algorithm at two spatial levels: (1) 10-m scale for absolute accuracy assessment using the references from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) simulations and flux-site observations, and (2) 500-m scale for large-scale mapping assessment by comparing the estimated albedo with the MODIS albedo product. Lastly, we presented four examples to show the capability of Sentinel-2 albedo in detecting fine-scale characteristics of vegetation and urban covers. Results show that: (1) the proposed algorithm accurately estimates surface albedo from Sentinel-2-like reflectance across different landscape configurations (overall root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 0.018, bias = 0.005, and coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.88); (2) the Sentinel-2-derived surface albedo agrees well with ground measurements (overall RMSE = 0.030, bias = -0.004, and R2 = 0.94) and MODIS products (overall RMSE = 0.030, bias = 0.021, and R2 = 0.97); and (3) Sentinel-2-derived albedo accurately captures seasonal leaf phenology and rapid snow events, and detects the interspecific (or interclass) variations of tree species and colored urban rooftops. These results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to map high-resolution surface albedo from Sentinel-2 satellites over large spatial and temporal contexts, suggesting the potential of using such fine-scale datasets to improve our understanding of albedo-related biophysical processes in the coupled human-environment system.}

abstract = {Poor air quality can provoke severe impacts on health, necessitating environmental monitoring of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) to assess potential threats to human well-being. However, traditional continuous air quality monitoring systems are often costly and time-consuming in data treatment. Lately, there is a growing trend towards the use of low-cost wireless PM sensors, providing more detailed information than standard systems. This paper presents a system designed to measure air quality, specifically, a wireless sensor network composed of a distributed sensor network linked to a cloud system. The proposed system can efficiently measure air quality as it is cost-effective, small-sized, and consumes little power. Sensor nodes based on low-power long range (LoRa) motes transmit field measurement data to the cloud via a gateway, and a cloud computing system is implemented to store, monitor, process, and visualise the data. Advanced techniques were included in our cloud for data processing and analysis to optimise the detection of PM. Laboratory and field tests in the historic Riotinto mine validate the system's viability, offering real-time air quality information for nearby populations. Once calibrated, sensors demonstrate high accuracy, presenting mean error of −0.3% and low deviation (R2 = 0.96) when compared to regulatory systems for both low (<10 μgPM10/m3) and hazardous concentrations (300 μgPM10/m3), which makes them perfect as early warning systems for atmospheric pollution in mining.}

How come certain safety concepts or theories or dispositive in the sense of Foucault emerge and become ‘dominating concepts’ or turning points in safety science? The paper considers a case from the past, namely that of Safety Management System (SMS), as a proxy to shed light on this question. The origins of SMS are explored to unravel what lies behind its emergence and development. The research is based on a literature review and open-ended interviews of 15 people who played a personal part in safety science or practices development before and/or when SMS started to emerge. Overall, the sample of interviewees represents a range of safety stakeholders (academia, industry, regulatory bodies, consulting companies) and high-risk industries to provide a diversity of perspectives on the emergence of SMS. The analysis of this material highlights several aspects that contributed to converge towards an approach like the SMS, beyond the identified limitations of safety science at that time. First, the intellectual context in which SMS emerged, was that of major developments on organizational and managerial dimensions of safety. Second, most safety stakeholders had motivations beyond safety enhancement to move towards a new approach. Last, the overall environment, way beyond safety and high-risk industries, facilitated the convergence towards an approach like the SMS. Eventually, this research demonstrates that safety is a situated science, situated not only in time, but also in a much wider economic, industrial, political, societal context. Putting safety into such perspective opens new avenues for reflecting about the future of safety science considering current trends not only in safety but also way beyond.}

Due to prevailing weather conditions and high emission density, this region is prone to the accumulation of air pollutants that often leads to severe haze events. In this study, we combined satellite and ground observations, and a regional air quality modeling system to quantify the contribution of open biomass burning to surface PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm) concentrations during a severe haze episode. During this period (November 1st - 4th, 2015), the average PM2.5 concentrations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces reached 116.98 μg/m3, 98.60 μg/m3, and 70.17 μg/m3 respectively. Model simulations showed that open biomass burning contributed to 52.7% of PM2.5 concentrations over Northeast China. Using the differences in active fire spots as detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suites (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-NPP, we estimated that the burning ban enforced in 2018 have caused the PM2.5 concentrations to decrease from the 2015 level by 67.10%, 53.23%, and 10.06% in the Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces respectively. Over the region, the burning ban proved to be effective in reducing fire emissions and lowering region-wide PM2.5 concentration by 48.1% during the post-harvest season.}

abstract = {Climate change refers to a complex series of changes in earth systems triggered primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels, land use changes, and other human activities. Climate change affects human health and well-being through many pathways, some direct, others indirect, and still others mediated through complex social and ecological pathways. These impacts manifest differently in different places and in different populations; vulnerability varies considerably. This chapter discusses five pathways that are particularly salient in tropical settings: heat; rising sea levels; severe weather events; infectious diseases; and threats to the food supply. For each of these, we sketch the health threat and the needed public health and clinical responses, known as adaptation, to protect public health. We conclude by discussing mitigation – the primary prevention of climate change – with a focus on implications for tropical regions.}

abstract = {Remote sensing of night light emissions in the visible band offers a unique opportunity to directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development. The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal changes during the night (for example from a geostationary platform or constellation of satellites), and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission (roughly analogous to the BRDF in daylight sensing). Perhaps most importantly, we make the case that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions, and monitor energy use.}

It is, therefore, important to understand how forest restoration treatments alter snowpack distribution and design the treatments accordingly. We use a combination of aerial lidar, multi-temporal terrestrial mobile lidar, and UAV photogrammetry to estimate rapidly changing snow depth and cover in northern Arizona, USA. We then examine the impact of forest structure and topography on snow depth and snow cover persistence to inform forest restoration treatments. Our results show that mobile lidar data can be used to estimate snow depth with standard errors of 8 cm when differenced with snow-off airborne lidar data. UAV-based Structure-from-Motion data can be used to estimate snow cover persistence with 92–97% overall accuracies in forested ecosystems. Random forest models indicate spatially varying importance of forest structural and topographic variables in predicting snow depth and cover persistence, when summarized at different spatial scales (from 5 m to 250 m) and with variable directional location offsets. Forest snow depth was best explained (R2 ≈ 0.46) by canopy height metrics at summary scales of >75 m, while canopy cover was most important at summary scales of <40 m (R2 ≈ 0.3). Snow cover persistence was best explained at very local scales by canopy cover (R2 ≈ 0.38) and less so at larger scales (>75 m) by topographic and forest patch characteristics (R2 ≈ 0.34). Our results demonstrate that 3-dimensional datasets are critical in rapidly characterizing changing snowpack to better understand the impacts of forest structure and topography to inform forest restoration treatment designs. The relationships observed in our study can inform currently ongoing regional-scale forest restoration in the southwest to improve forest health and resiliency.}

Every country has its own set of regulatory bodies for handling the disasters. Whereas, these arrangements do not suffice the safety and need disaster sufferers. Most of the disaster becomes the disastrous because of a lack of timely help to reach the sufferer. Such an issue can be solved with the help of technology like IoT (Internet of Things). IoT is an ITC tool through which a governing body can cope with problems created by the disaster. In this chapter, an insight into the use of IoT in the management of disasters is presented. The work presents the present challenges and issues for using IoT effectively in the disaster management. Some study about handling the disasters like forest fire, landslide, earthquake is discussed. Finally, some future direction has been given for the research to be carried out in using the IoT for managing the disasters.}

Although these companies have been developing programs to mitigate the impacts caused by COVID-19, researchers have been worried about a possible weakening of the adoption of sustainable initiatives due to a focus on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic. Grounded on the Resource Orchestration Theory, the goal of this study was to assess the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on sustainable (environmental, social, and economic) performance in the context of agri-food supply chains. To do so, a questionnaire survey was used to collect data from 349 different medium and large agri-food companies in Brazil. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares technique. This study has found out that, under the impacts arising from COVID-19 pandemic (1) supply management and transportation and logistics management had a positive impact on food supply chains' sustainable performance; (2) the effects of relationship management and supply chain wide impact management were found to be negative on sustainable performance; and (3) the effects of demand and production management on sustainable performance were not considered significant. We propose a framework that clearly represents the relationship between the disrupted supply chain areas and sustainable performance through the development of orchestration capabilities. By knowing which kinds of impacts produce the most significant effects on sustainable performance, policy makers and managers will be able to make decisions and take actions to avoid negative effects and to improve firms’ sustainable performance.}

Those measurements at fixed stations, however, are rather discrete spatially, thus cannot provide full coverage of the air quality status in a larger area. Such full coverage is essential in some studies of the effects of air pollution, for instance, in epidemiological studies for the health effects of different air pollutants. There are two directions toward higher spatial coverage of air quality monitoring. The first one is to massively deploy low-cost air pollution monitoring sensors in the areas of interest. The second one is to use mobile measurement platforms, instead of fixed stations, to perform air pollution monitoring. These two strategies are also related to some extent, because the low-cost sensors are normally compact and miniature, and some of them are very suitable for the deployment onboard mobile platforms.}

A collaborative group of UAVs operating in an ad hoc manner known as a flying ad hoc network (FANET) can accomplish complex tasks more efficiently. However, owing to the high mobility of UAVs, such applications remain limited by a few key challenges, including dynamic time-varying topologies, energy constraints, frequent link breakages, inter-UAV collisions, and external obstacle avoidance. A proper topology control algorithm (TCA) for UAV swarms with reasonable overhead helps to optimize both mission and communication performance in FANET. Thus, TCA provides wider coverage ensuring the quality of service in aerial connectivity. Additionally, it supports the efficient energy management, better target exploration, improved formation stability while ensuring inter-UAV collision avoidance, external obstacle avoidance, lower interference, and the enhanced autonomy of UAV swarms. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of available TCAs for FANET, and provide a novel taxonomy of TCAs based on the FANET topology architectures and underlying mathematical models. Through an in-depth assessment of recent innovative research articles and their comparative studies, we aim to provide novel insights into the latest technologies for autonomous cooperative coordination. The key open research issues and their respective solutions are addressed as future research directions.}

abstract = {Climate-smart forestry (CSF) is an emerging branch of sustainable adaptive forest management aimed at enhancing the potential of forests to adapt to and mitigate climate change. It relies on much higher data requirements than traditional forestry. These data requirements can be met by new devices that support continuous, in situ monitoring of forest conditions in real time. We propose a comprehensive network of sensors, i.e., a wireless sensor network (WSN), that can be part of a worldwide network of interconnected uniquely addressable objects, an Internet of Things (IoT), which can make data available in near real time to multiple stakeholders, including scientists, foresters, and forest managers, and may partially motivate citizens to participate in big data collection. The use of in situ sources of monitoring data as ground-truthed training data for remotely sensed data can boost forest monitoring by increasing the spatial and temporal scales of the monitoring, leading to a better understanding of forest processes and potential threats. Here, some of the key developments and applications of these sensors are outlined, together with guidelines for data management. Examples are given of their deployment to detect early warning signals (EWS) of ecosystem regime shifts in terms of forest productivity, health, and biodiversity. Analysis of the strategic use of these tools highlights the opportunities for engaging citizens and forest managers in this new generation of forest monitoring.
La foresterie intelligente face au climat est une branche émergente de la gestion forestière adaptative et durable dont l’objectif est d’accroître la capacité des forêts de s’adapter au changement climatique et d’en atténuer les effets. Cela comporte beaucoup plus d’exigences en termes de données que la foresterie traditionnelle. Ces exigences en matière de données peuvent être satisfaites grâce à de nouveaux appareils qui permettent de surveiller la forêt in situ en continu et en temps réel. Nous proposons un réseau complet de capteurs, c.-à-d. un réseau de capteurs sans fil, qui peut faire partie d’un réseau mondial d’objets interconnectés individuellement adressables, un Internet des objets (IdO) qui peut rendre les données disponibles presque en temps réel à de nombreux intéressés, incluant des scientifiques, des forestiers et des gestionnaires forestiers, et qui peut en partie motiver les citoyens à participer à une importante collecte de données. L’utilisation de sources in situ de données de suivi comme données d’entraînement validées sur le terrain pour des données de télédétection peut favoriser la surveillance des forêts en augmentant les échelles spatiale et temporelle, permettant ainsi une meilleure compréhension des processus forestiers et des menaces potentielles. Certains des développements et applications clés de ces capteurs sont présentés dans cet article avec des directives pour la gestion des données. Des exemples de leur déploiement pour détecter les signaux d’alerte rapide des changements de régime des écosystèmes en ce qui a trait à la productivité, l’état de santé et la biodiversité de la forêt sont présentés. L’analyse de l’utilisation stratégique de ces outils met en évidence les occasions d’intéresser les citoyens et les gestionnaires forestiers à cette nouvelle génération de suivi des forêts.

abstract = {Even though corporate sustainability management has become a major topic of research and of the business world, its digitalization is still in an infancy stage. One of the reasons for this situation is the fact that domain-specific abstractions, which are a major underpinning of digitalization in general, have so far received very little attention. This is particularly a major obstacle for the digitalization of the work area of corporate environmental compliance management (CECM), which is intended to ensure that the firm complies with environmental legislation. Using general system theory, the CECM area is analyzed, and a set of domain-specific abstractions is proposed. Further contributions of the article are focused on two crucial CECM decision tasks: the relevance assessment of environmental regulations and the determination of compliance enforcement measures. Based on the abstractions, decision schemes and tailored domain-specific templates of decision trees for these tasks are suggested and demonstrated through a running example. It is expected that through these novel building blocks, this research contributes to an advancement of the digitalization of CECM processes and of sustainability management in general. For example, the proposed building blocks may serve as a foundation for the development of compliance management information systems that offer smart assistance for CECM tasks. Digital assistance may mitigate deficiencies in CECM expertise and CECM experience, which are often imposed in practice by tight budget constraints.}

To date, efforts to do this have been rare, especially in large rivers, as they require appropriate tools for quantifying habitat heterogeneity with fine-scale resolution across broad spatial extents. In this study, we used side-scan sonar technology to map riverbed substrate at six sites in the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers. Substrate maps were then analyzed and visualized using geospatial analysis to relate fine-grained spatial substrate patterns to process domain structure. Our findings revealed two distinct nested domains of substrate patchiness, suggesting that different factors are responsible for shaping patterns of substrate at different scales. Although small-scale patchiness in substrate was likely driven by internal, or autogenic, physical processes, patterns at larger segment extents (>3 km) were often driven by abrupt transitions in habitat related to exogenous factors such as lateral erosion of talus, tributary inputs, and bank armoring. Additionally, we found that heterogeneity in benthic substrate increased with spatial extent at all of our study sites; however, this relationship was lower in the Missouri River, which is altered by impoundment. Our study represents one of the first efforts to relate benthic habitat heterogeneity to nested process domain structure in large riverscapes, and offers a unique perspective for linking landscape processes, geomorphological habitat heterogeneity, and biological structure and function in large rivers.}

Field measurements assessed soil loss as the mean vertical depth along 135 trail transects across the Appalachian Trail sampled along three 5 km trail segments in New Hampshire’s White Mountains National Forest, chosen due to its exceptionally high use and impact. GIS and LiDAR data were used to create many new variables reflecting terrain characteristics that were expected to influence trail erosion and improve predictive models of trail system soil loss. A variety of terrain and hydrology characteristics were applied to model trail soil loss at three spatial scales: transect, trail corridor, and watershed. The model for each spatial scale and a combined model are presented. The adjusted R2 explaining variation in soil loss is 0.57 using variables from all spatial scales, improving on predictive modeling from earlier studies. Environmental and trail design factors such as slope and watershed flow length were found to be significantly correlated to soil loss and have implications for improved sustainable trail design and management.}

In the short-term phase, blocked roads can jeopardize emergency operations such as search-and-rescue, evacuation of victims, and the distribution of emergency supplies. The detritus may pose an environmental challenge in the long-term, as the rubble must be properly collected, disposed of, and recycled. Optimization models designed to schedule repair and restoration activities and determine the repair crews' routes are helpful to give insights to decision-makers on how to improve emergency response plans. This article presents a literature review on short and long-term network models designed for roads repair and restoration. This review identifies the trends in publications, solution approaches, frequency of locations and type of disaster in the case studies, and the size of the networks. In addition, a qualitative analysis of the models’ characteristics, such as the type of network, uncertainties, and interdependencies, is presented. A discussion is provided to indicate future research directions. Among these, future research should focus on the combination of roads repair and restoration with other emergency activities such as relief distribution.}

abstract = {Flying Ad-Hoc Network (FANET) formed by a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is currently a trending research topic because of its capability in performing complex tasks more rapidly and efficiently. However, the high-speed mobility of UAVs, limited energy, and dynamically changing topology have led to critical challenges for the reliability of communication between UAVs, especially when designing routing schemes in FANET. In this paper, we introduce a Mobility-based Weighted Cluster Routing Scheme (MWCRSF) for FANET performance enhancement within the constraints of network resources. MWCRSF utilizes the high-level search efficiency of the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and a new clustering algorithm based on SSA is first proposed to set up the initial UAV clusters. A weighted sum-based algorithm is then proposed for Cluster Head (CH) selection, where the residual energy, node correlation degree, relative mobility, distance to the Base Station (BS), and average distance are adopted as the selection criteria. To keep the UAV clusters updated, an efficient cluster maintenance algorithm is proposed as well. In order to provide timely and reliable data transmission to the BS, the optimal next-hop route selection is performed considering the link lifetime, residual energy, and distance between nodes and BS. We exploit the power of skyline operators in multi-criteria decision-making to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of CH selection and next-hop routing. The simulation results reveal that the proposed MWCRSF scheme outperforms the existing methods under different metrics including cluster lifetime, energy efficiency, throughput, and network lifetime.}

In this paper, we presented the development process, main contents, significance, and limitations of the 3rd Adaptation Plan as a helpful case for the international community to consult in formulating their national adaptation plans. The plan aims to implement a climate-safe nation with the people, and its development process features a scientific evidence basis and participation of various parties. It systematically and organically recommends 232 measures to be implemented by the Korean government and related departments for the next five years to enhance the adaptive capacity to 84 climate risks. Through expert forums, working council on climate change adaptation, adaptation governance forums, online public hearings, and discussion on preparing public-oriented countermeasures, 41 representative public-oriented tasks in eight sectors were selected. The plan consists of measures to resolve national climate risks constructed based on scientific evidence. All adaptation parties participated in the entire process of establishing the adaptation plan and evaluating its implementation. Significantly, the 3rd Adaptation Plan attempts to overcome the limitations of the 2nd adaptation plan by planning for the operation of a citizen evaluation group. However, the plan's limitations have been identified as insufficient willingness to monitor and implement measures, differences in the spectrum of adaptation measures by a government department, and lack of publicity in the English language. The measures to deal with these shortcomings are being sought.}

abstract = {Sediment transport (bedload and suspension) plays a relevant role in the morphological response of river channels to large floods. Sediment load controls erosion and aggradation patterns during high flows, drives the migration of macroforms and contributes to the definition of thresholds for bank erosion and channel instability. Given this influence on channel morphology, it is clear that sediment transport influences both the channel geometry and water stage reached during floods and should therefore be considered in flood hazard analysis. So far, however, legislation on flood hazard and flood management plans still continues to typically disregard sediment transport. This is due mainly to the paucity of available data on sediment transport and the lack of standardized approaches for its integration into flood hazard analysis. The present work, which aims to provide some guidance on how to advance in this issue, has undertaken a bibliometric study and thorough review of the published scientific literature that had previously addressed the implications of sediment transport on flood hazards assessment. This review showed that: i) most studies on the influence of sediment transport on flood risk have focused on mountain streams, as they are highly sensitive systems to changes in sediment supply; ii) research has also focused on explaining historical changes in channel-conveyance capacity and flood frequency based on long-term trends in sediment supply; and iii) recent developments in hydrodynamic and morphodynamic numerical models provide opportunities to explicitly incorporate sediment transport in flood hazard analysis. However, despite the recent advances, we have identified important challenges and discussed needs to better consider sediment transport in flood hazards at different spatial and temporal scales.}

In aquatic media, calcium and carbonate ions react to form hydrous and anhydrous CaCO3-containig solids in types of amorphous and crystalline phases, with calcite, aragonite and dolomite being the most frequent carbonate minerals in the Earth's crust.

We then propose two mechanisms through which CSR engagement shields manufacturing firms against external disruptions: employee motivation and customer loyalty.

This branch of knowledge is known as Swarm Robotics, which refers to the development of tools and techniques to ease the coordination of multiple small-sized robots towards the accomplishment of difficult tasks or missions in a collaborative fashion. The success of Swarm Robotics applications comes from the efficient use of smart sensing, communication and organization functionalities endowed to these small robots, which allow for collaborative information sensing, operation and knowledge inference from the environment. The numerous industrial and social applications that can be addressed efficiently by virtue of swarm robotics unleashes a vibrant research area focused on distributing intelligence among autonomous agents with simple behavioral rules and communication schedules, yet potentially capable of realizing the most complex tasks.

They also play important roles in climate and biogeochemical cycles, including through nutrient deposition in the ocean.

Many gaps remain in addressing fundamental questions regarding why volcanic ash deposition may enhance or limit both phytoplankton growth and/or drive community composition shifts. Here we outline a wide, multidisciplinary vision for monitoring volcanic eruptions near ocean ecosystems from satellites, including considerations for characteristics of airborne volcanic ash and ash geochemistry in seawater. Ultimately, observations beyond chlorophyll-a are needed to quantify phytoplankton communities (including harmful algal blooms) and possible impacts across higher trophic levels. We synthesize relevant research from volcanic studies as well as atmospheric and ocean sciences to identify the ‘known unknowns’ in ash-ecosystem studies. Our goal is to move toward an improved understanding of how real-time and near-real-time monitoring of volcanic eruptions can help address societally relevant questions.}

abstract = {The population of the United States is getting older. Unlike other countries with aging populations, however, the state of aging in the United States is in crisis. Healthcare and social reforms will likely be necessary in the coming decades to address structural issues with retirement, socio-economic inequality, and the high cost of healthcare. In the meantime, AI-enabled smart technologies and environments are being rapidly developed to assist overwhelmed caretakers, enable access to healthcare providers, address isolation and depression among older adults, and provide mobility to and from essential services in sprawling suburbs and rural areas. This study utilizes a participatory, intuitive logics approach to construct scenarios of aging in smart environments in 2050 that illuminate the uncertainties, challenges, and opportunities presented by the coming confluence of two mega trends: an aging population and increasingly sensed people and environments. The results include four scenarios including descriptions and key features, and with narratives available in the appendix. In the discussion, we reflect on five provocations distilled from expert interviews to illustrate what aging might look like in 2050 from a variety of socio-economic vantage points and mediated by technological capabilities and arrangements born of differing policy, economic, and societal conditions.}

abstract = {Taking robotic patents between 1977 and 2017 and building upon the topic modeling technique, we extract their latent topics, analyze how important these topics are over time, and how they are related to each other looking at how often they are recombined in the same patents. This allows us to differentiate between more and less important technological trends in robotics based on their stage of diffusion and position in the space of knowledge represented by a topic graph, where some topics appear isolated while others are highly interconnected. Furthermore, utilizing external reference texts that characterize service robots from a technical perspective, we propose and apply a novel approach to match the constructed topics to service robotics. The matching procedure is based on frequency and exclusivity of words overlapping between the patents and the reference texts. We identify around 20 topics belonging to service robotics. Our results corroborate earlier findings, but also provide novel insights on the content and stage of development of application areas in service robotics. With this study we contribute to a better understanding of the highly dynamic field of robotics as well as to new practices of utilizing the topic modeling approach, matching the resulting topics to external classifications and applying to them metrics from graph theory.}

abstract = {A systematic review and inventory of recent research relating to optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation was conducted, and thematic and geographical trends were summarized. Research was broadly categorized into four major themes of (1) time series, including NDVI trends and shrub expansion; (2) disturbance and recovery, including tundra fires, winter warming, herbivory, permafrost disturbance, and anthropogenic change; (3) vegetation properties, including biomass, primary productivity, seasonality, phenology, and pigments; and (4) classification and mapping. Remaining challenges associated with remote sensing of Arctic vegetation were divided into three categories and discussed. The first are issues related to environmental controls including disturbance, hydrology, plant functional types, phenology and the tundra-taiga ecotone, and understanding their influence on interpretation and validation of derived remote sensing trends. The second are issues of upscaling and extrapolation related to sensor physics and the comparability of data from multiple spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. The final category identifies more philosophical challenges surrounding the future of data accessibility, big data analysis, sharing and funding policies among major data providers such as national space agencies and private companies, as well as user groups in the public and private sectors. The review concludes that the best practices for the advancement of optical remote sensing of Arctic vegetation include (1) a continued effort to share and improve in situ-validated datasets using camera networks and small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (2) data fusion with non-optical data, (3) sensor continuity, consistency, and comparability, and (4) free availability and increased sharing of data. These efforts are necessary to generate high quality, temporally dense datasets for identifying trends in Arctic tundra vegetation.}

abstract = {Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems as habitats for many animal and plant species and are crucial for disaster mitigation, improving environmental quality, storing carbon, and responding to climate change. However, these sensitive ecosystems have been heavily affected by anthropogenic activities, including aquaculture. In this study, we used multitemporal satellite imagery integrated with a verified field survey method to map the coverage of the wetland ecosystem in the Dong Rui commune, Tien Yen district, Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam, five times for four periods from 1975 to 2022, with high accuracy (overall accuracy = 92.3%, Kappa = 0.91). The results showed that from 1975 to 2000, the area of mangrove forests declined sharply (by nearly 2,000 ha), mainly due to policies of development and conversion of land use. From 2000 to 2022, the mangrove forest area was gradually restored, while the area under aquaculture shrank. Anthropogenic impacts, especially the effects of local economic development, and conservation and developmental policies, are the main causes of continuous change in each short period. Our study demonstrates satellite imagery as an effective tool for assessing wetland ecosystem area fluctuations and assessing the extent of human impacts on this natural ecosystem. Our findings can serve as a basis for planning, conservation strategies, and sustainable development of wetland ecosystems and for improving the associated livelihoods of the communities.}

abstract = {This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the energy supply chain, its main constituents, and the complexity of their interactions from a multidisciplinary perspective: technical, economic, and environmental. The first section presents the reader with the distribution of renewable and nonrenewable energy resources alongside an overview of their share in the global energy consumption and of the main transportation routes. The need to convert the raw (primary) energy resources into secondary forms of energy (energy carriers) due to safety, technical practicality, or economic reasons and the technologies available to do so are discussed later. This paves the way to discuss energy storage as a cornerstone of the supply chain, bridging the regional mismatch between production and consumption nodes, securing future energy supplies, and, overall, guaranteeing the reliability and resilience of the energy supply chain. The last sections of the chapter introduce the dynamics of the global energy market, with a focus on natural gas, as well as considerations about environmental regulations in North America and the European Union (EU).}
