abstract = {Large-scale fires in urban areas have highlighted the need to develop ways of assessing the risks posed by smoke plumes to people and the environment. One of the challenges is to quickly provide the authorities with information on the areas affected by the plume and the levels of pollutant concentration to which people may have been exposed. In this work, we develop an inverse modelling method to find the smoke source term of a large-scale fire by assimilating in-situ pollutant concentration measurements. A Bayesian method based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is considered to determine the source characteristics and their uncertainties. The source is described by a time-varying emission rate and an emission height. The latter, linked to the phenomenon of plume rise, is an important parameter for assessing the pollution impact in the vicinity of the fire. An inversion proposal that forces the system to choose a single emission height is introduced. These inverse methodologies are applied to the real case study of a major warehouse fire in Aubervilliers, near Paris, in 2021. In most cases of application, certain information, such as the pollution already present before the fire, may be difficult to estimate, particularly in an operational situation. Fine-tuning of the inverse method to make it more robust for transposition to future case studies are then discussed.}

In this research field, biologically inspired metaheuristics have been proposed to mimics swarms, flocks, and other coordination schemas. The design and management of such systems is a research challenge when considering (i) combination and optimization of multiple metaheuristics and (ii) enhancements of biologically inspired metaheuristic through technological advances. In this paper the swarm coordination of UAVs employed in target search is based on flocking and stigmergy, to provide robust formation control and dynamic environmental information sharing, respectively. The design of both metaheuristics takes into account UAVs equipment, and the coordination logic is adapted to the mission by means of a differential evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm optimizes the aggregated structural parameters of all metaheuristics to allow the most efficient coordination with respect to the mission environment. Some possible enhancements of stigmergy are studied by simulating target search tasks on synthetic and real-world scenarios.}

abstract = {In this paper, we design and implement a novel generic mobility model, named Alpha-based, for a fleet of small interconnected UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) that collaborate to explore a geographic area (battle field, research and rescue missions, surveillance applications, etc.). In fact, due to the significant impact of mobility models on the networking performance, the mobility models must realistically capture the UAV’s attributes. Hence, we propose to use a combination of energy level, coverage-area and network connectivity for mobility decision-making, in contrast to the literature where only network connectivity and area coverage are investigated. On the one hand, these two metrics are very important, especially for applications where achieving the best area-coverage and maintaining network connectivity represent an essential requirement. On the other hand, energy is another equally noteworthy constraint that should be taken into account. In fact, being a crucial resource for all mobile devices and especially for UAVs, the energy becomes vital to ensure the network lifetime and mission success. As far as we know, Alpha-based mobility model is the first to ever consider a combination of these three metrics within the same decision-making criterion. A distributed scheme is adopted, where each UAV determines locally its future movement based on the information it receives from its neighbors. Moreover, a novel fuzzy inference system is implemented in order to compute the values of a followship weighting parameter, named Alpha. This latter is used to choose the most suitable neighboring UAV to follow. To validate the proposed mobility model, rigorous testing has been accomplished, through simulation work. Compared to Random-based and Forces-based mobility models, the Alpha-based mobility model achieves good coverage rate while maintaining connectivity.}

abstract = {Hollows in standing trees are an important ecological resource for many Australian vertebrates, including a range of threatened mammals, reptiles and birds. However, the ecology of tree hollows, and the extent to which they support hollow-dependent fauna, has been severely under-studied in northern Australia. This study evaluated the reliability of ground-based surveys of tree hollows in a northern Australian eucalypt savanna. We counted hollows in trees using two approaches: (1) ground-based surveys and (2) climbing surveys, i.e. double sampling. Assuming that climbing surveys are accurate, ground-based surveys tended to overestimate hollow density (per tree) by around 15%. However, of the hollows counted in the climbing surveys (n = 202), 44.5% were blocked by hard termitaria. Once unavailable (blocked) hollows were accounted for, ground-based surveys tended to overestimate available hollow density (per tree) by 59%. According to generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), a hollow was more likely to be blocked if it had a smaller entrance diameter, occurred on a tree with a termite mound at its base and smaller DBH. We calibrated site-level ground-based counts using GLMMs of climbing counts and available climbing counts as a function of ground-based counts for double-sampled trees. Overall, our uncalibrated counts resulted in over-reporting of mean site-based density of available hollows by 38%. The discrepancy between densities of total hollows and available hollows has important implications for the conservation of many threatened and declining species known to rely on tree hollows in northern Australia. We suggest that when conducting ground-based hollow surveys to assess tree hollow availability in northern Australia, a subsample of trees should be double-sampled, i.e. both ground-based and climbing counts, to account for survey error due to the blocking of hollows by termitaria.}

The wildfires jeopardize general wellbeing, security, and require high levels of government resources. They also lead to noteworthy debasement of nature, property loss, and high rates of human death and injury. This paper proposes an algorithm to use and route unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to mitigate forest fire risks. The developed matheuristic algorithm hybridizes simulated annealing and local search metaheuristics with an integer linear programming model. The mathematical model was developed to solve the distance-constrained multi-based multi-UAV routing problem, and because of the complexity of the problem, the generated metaheuristics helps the model to find better solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed matheuristic is tested with a real-life case study for Turkey and is also compared with a genetic algorithm. The Turkish State Meteorological Service generates forest fire-risk maps countrywide every day to predict fire risks 3 days later by using meteorological data. These maps are used to generate the risky regions to be visited by the UAVs, and the existing airports are considered for the UAVs to take off and land. The algorithm is coded using MATLAB and ILOG. The metaheuristics are designed with problem-based operators, and their parameters are tuned by experiments. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm and the hybridization procedures. Results demonstrate that the CPU times for the methods are acceptable.}

A field study in the Kitchener/Waterloo region inspired the development of a framework that has three underlying systems encompassing digital tools for data collection and analysis: (1) The Real Environment uses 3D scanners and a spreadsheet software, (2) The Model Environment uses Building Information Modeling (BIM) software and a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool, and (3) The Core Engine uses an optimization program. Real-world data collected from RCM stores (The Habitat for Humanity) and NCM stores (The Home Depot) are used for a realistic demonstration of the framework. By practically applying the framework to source window and door components for a modeled multi-residential building design, an integrated selection of 35% RCMs and 65% NCMs was proposed for the building design. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is also performed for validation. The framework may disrupt the ongoing building design practices that deem material reuse problematic by enabling flexible sourcing of used and new building materials. A modular and iterative framework for facilitating reuse is thus contributed.}

We used a gradient-boosted trees regression model with ancillary datasets as predictors to model and predict canopy height across various vegetation biomes. Overall, the fitted model achieved an R2 value of 0.76, a mean bias of 0.1 m, a general over-estimation, and MAE (mean absolute error) of 2.5 m on a hold-out validation dataset of 21,185 observations. Model performance varied across biomes (R2 = 0.49–0.73, mean biases = −0.3 to 0.8 m, MAE = 1.4 to 3.3 m). Independent accuracy assessment with airborne lidar (R2 = 0.72, MAE = 3.9 m) and canopy height models from the NEON program (R2 = 0.67, MAE = 6.9 m) also showed generally consistent agreement. In general, our developed canopy height product performed better in relatively homogenous environments or dense forests such as mangroves, flooded, coniferous or broadleaf and mixed forests than in relatively sparse environments associated with deserts, and chapparal forests. The generated canopy height product, designated as the continental canopy height map (CCHM), is publicly available and contributes to spatially explicit canopy height datasets over the US at an enhanced 30 m Landsat spatial resolution.}

Free- and medium-resolution satellite imagery is a useful tool that allows scientific researchers and management organizations to monitor forest development in developing countries, such as Vietnam. In this study, we used SPOT 4 and Planet remote sensing data to assess land-use status fluctuations in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau area, Vietnam, between 2000 and 2021 (the overall accuracy was 90.52%, Kappa value = 0.89). The results showed that from 2000 to 2010, the rate of natural forest loss in this area was 0.32%/year, of which, more than 6500 ha were converted to other uses. Between 2010 and 2021, the rate of natural forest loss gradually decreased (0.09%/year) instead of fluctuating between different types of land use. The area of forests, perennial crop land, and annual crop land tended to increase from 2000 to 2010; however, from 2010 to 2021, the area of plantation forests decreased markedly, while the area of perennial crop land and annual crop land continued to expand. The analysis of the policies on forest management, exploitation, and protection was applied locally, to explain the causes of the change in spatiotemporal aspects of the types of land-use cover in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. Restoring forest areas during 2010–2021 initially improved effectiveness in forest management and protection. Furthermore, the results provide a better understanding of the current position and role of the government apparatus, cadres, and ethnic minorities in socioeconomic development associated with forest protection and development on the Kon Ha Nung Plateau. The results of this study can help managers monitor annual forest-cover fluctuations based on free remote sensing imagery to reduce both the cost of management and surveying, yielding relatively accurate results.}

In this study, we investigated the effects of stand-level fire history and individual tree attributes on tree hollow abundance in two forest types in Namadgi National Park in the Australian Capital Territory: subalpine woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieber ex Spreng (snow gum); and tall-open E. delegatensis R.T.Baker (alpine ash) montane forest. These forests can be differentiated by their distinct response to fire; E. pauciflora resprouts following fire and E. delegatensis reproduces exclusively via seed. We employed a ground-based approach to measure 1044 trees across 36 sites selected by forest type and fire history as recorded since 1920. For both species, hollow abundance decreased with total fire count at stand level and increased for E. delegatensis in response to an extensive wildfire that occurred in the study area in 2003. The probability of a tree containing a hollow increased with tree diameter and if the tree was dead. Our results show that fire frequency and severity have strong implications for tree hollow abundance in montane and subalpine eucalypt forests.}

abstract = {Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50 years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.}

abstract = {Ambient-awareness in conjunction with pervasive computing is a significant challenge for system designers. It follows the necessity of gathering raw, massive and heterogeneous environmental data which we obtained, while middleware processes must merge context modelling and reasoning seamlessly. We proposed a system supporting mountain rescuers which is demanding due to the large number of environmental objects interacting, as well as high data variability. We presented complex context processing embedded in the proposed context life cycle and implemented it in a difficult mountain environment. We introduced five weather scenarios which are a basis for contextual and perceptual processing during the validation of our model. The system merges a message streaming broker for massive data transport, low and high-level processing algorithms, repositories and a logical SAT solver. It constitutes a Context-Aware-as-a-Service (CAaaS) system, offering advanced support for mountain rescue operations. The provided software model defines middleware components which act on a predicted context and transform in situ sensor data into smart decisions, and which could operate as a platform-based cloud computing model. It is an enabler yielding a synergy effect with different software components orchestration when providing pro-activeness and non-intrusiveness concerning smart decisions.}

It encompasses several heterogeneous resource and communication standard in ensuring incessant availability of service. At the same time, the development of 6G enables the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in offering cost and time-efficient solution to several applications like healthcare, surveillance, disaster management, etc. In UAV networks, energy efficiency and data collection are considered the major process for high quality network communication. But these procedures are found to be challenging because of maximum mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and energy restricted UAVs. These issues are solved by the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and energy efficient clustering techniques for UAVs in the 6G environment. With this inspiration, this work designs an artificial intelligence enabled cooperative cluster-based data collection technique for unmanned aerial vehicles (AECCDC-UAV) in 6G environment. The proposed AECCDC-UAV technique purposes for dividing the UAV network as to different clusters and allocate a cluster head (CH) to each cluster in such a way that the energy consumption (ECM) gets minimized. The presented AECCDC-UAV technique involves a quasi-oppositional shuffled shepherd optimization (QOSSO) algorithm for selecting the CHs and construct clusters. The QOSSO algorithm derives a fitness function involving three input parameters residual energy of UAVs, distance to neighboring UAVs, and degree of UAVs. The performance of the AECCDC-UAV technique is validated in many aspects and the obtained experimental values demonstration promising results over the recent state of art methods.}

We analyse perspectives about 40 policy options to address peatland fires in Indonesia, using a Q methodology approach to rank the options according to perceived effectiveness. Peatland fires in Indonesia are a long-standing and complex social-ecological challenge, where unsolved disagreements about policy options have profound implications for environmental governance, resulting in fires recurring and causing significant CO2 emissions and transboundary haze that affects the health of millions. We collected data from 219 respondents, covering twelve stakeholder categories, including small and large landholders, industrial farmers, scientists, local leaders and government officials. We identified the most representative response from each stakeholder category, and used hierarchical cluster analysis to explore the closeness/distance in perspectives among categories. The results show a particularly noticeable distinction between two broad groups, which we labelled as experts and resource users. Experts tend to prefer solutions that are centralised and largely transformative, whereas resource users favour more localised measures that are more compatible with business-as-usual. We discuss possible reasons for these differences, and their implications for environmental governance, including for how scientists engage in policy.}

This paper investigates a new routing problem of small UAVs for information collection with time windows, where UAVs can be recharged at platforms (e.g. ground vehicles or stations) distributed in a given area. Different from the previous works on UAV routing, the UAVs are allowed to partially recharge their batteries according to the requirement in the following route. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model is developed to formulate the problem, where the overall time for completing all targets’ observation and the number of UAVs are minimized. An improved adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm with simulated annealing strategies is designed, and a recharging platform insertion heuristic is developed to determine the recharging strategy and construct feasible solutions. To verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, a set of new benchmark instances are designed based on the well-known Solomon data set and solved. The computational results are compared with those obtained by the ant colony optimization and variable neighborhood search, which shows that ALNS performs significantly better and stable. Furthermore, experimental analysis indicates that important advantages can be obtained through introducing the recharging strategy for small UAVs.}

Unlike traditional approaches, this value system does not need in advance the precise characteristics of the intended behaviours. We examine the performance of this value system in a series of controlled experiments. Our results demonstrate that the value system can recognise multiple “interesting” structured collective behaviours and distinguish them from random movement patterns. Results show that our value system is most effective distinguishing structured behaviours from random behaviours when using motion properties of individual agents as input. Further variations and modifications to input data such as normalisation and aggregation were also investigated, and it was shown that certain configurations provide better results in distinguishing collective behaviours from random ones.}

abstract = {Characterization of forest structure is important for management-related decision making, monitoring, and adaptive management. Increasingly, observations of forest structure are needed at both finer resolutions and across greater extents to support spatially explicit management planning. Unmanned aerial system (UAS) based photogrammetry provides an airborne method of forest structure data acquisition at a significantly lower cost and time commitment than existing methods such as airborne laser scanning (LiDAR). This study utilizes nearly 5000 stem-mapped trees in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) dominated forests to evaluate several algorithms for detecting individual tree locations and characterizing crown area across tree sizes. Our results indicate that adaptive variable window detection methods with UAS-based canopy height models have greater tree detection rates compared with fixed window analysis across a range of tree sizes. Using the UAS approach, probability of detecting individual trees decreases from 97% for dominant overstory to 67% for suppressed understory trees. Additionally, crown radii were correctly determined within 0.5 m for approximately two-thirds of sampled trees. These findings highlight the potential for UAS photogrammetry to characterize forest structure through the detection of trees and tree groups in open-canopy ponderosa pine forests. Further work should investigate how these methods transfer to more diverse species compositions and forest structures.
Il est important de caractériser la structure forestière pour éclairer les décisions de gestion, le suivi et la gestion adaptative. De plus en plus, des observations de la structure forestière sont nécessaires, tant à des résolutions plus fines que sur de plus vastes étendues, pour soutenir une planification de gestion spatialement explicite. La photogrammétrie basée sur des systèmes aériens sans pilote (SASP) fournit une méthode aéroportée d’acquisition de données sur la structure forestière à un coût et un investissement en temps nettement inférieurs à ceux des méthodes existantes telles que le balayage laser aéroporté. Cette étude utilise près de 5 000 tiges d’arbre cartographiées, dans des forêts dominées par le pin ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson), pour évaluer plusieurs algorithmes de détection de l’emplacement des arbres individuels et de caractérisation de la surface de la couronne des arbres de différentes tailles. Nos résultats indiquent que les méthodes adaptatives de détection à fenêtre variable avec des modèles de hauteur du couvert forestier sur la base des données de SASP ont des taux de détection d’arbres plus élevés que l’analyse à fenêtre fixe pour un assortiment de tailles d’arbres. Avec l’utilisation des SASP, la probabilité de détecter des arbres individuels passe de 97 % pour l’étage dominant à 67 % pour les arbres opprimés du sous-étage. De plus, les rayons de la couronne ont été correctement déterminés, à moins de 0,5 m, pour environ les deux tiers des arbres échantillonnés. Ces résultats mettent en évidence le potentiel de la photogrammétrie basée sur les SASP pour caractériser la structure forestière grâce à la détection d’arbres et de groupes d’arbres dans les forêts de pins ponderosa dont le couvert n’est pas fermé. Des travaux supplémentaires devraient étudier comment ces méthodes peuvent s’appliquer à des compositions d’espèces et des structures forestières plus diverses. [Traduit par la Rédaction]}

abstract = {Unmanned vehicles have been widely used for sensing, surveillance, surveying, communication, transportation, and many other purposes. Navigation is always an essential operational function in the course of their movements. In the case of the absence of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals, the positioning need of an unmanned vehicle is generally empowered by its onboard Inertial Navigation System (INS). An inherent deficiency of INS, however, is that position errors inevitably occur and will gradually accumulate over time. A feasible approach to correcting errors is to use the fixed reference points with known coordinates in the cruising environment, which we call landmarks, to calibrate the vehicle’s position when it passes by. The vehicle must choose a path along which a sufficient number of landmarks can serve the position calibration requirement. In such a context, this paper introduces a joint landmark selection and path planning problem for unmanned vehicles navigating in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments, in which the vehicles’ position drifting errors need to be rectified through communicating with preset landmarks. To characterize and tackle the problem, a set of new types of subpaths are defined and a bi-objective integer programming model using this building block is formulated for simultaneously minimizing the landmark deployment cost and the vehicle cruise distance. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm, which features a multi-criterion label-correcting form, is developed for searching for the Pareto-optimal solution set of landmark and path selections. Numerical and computational analyses are conducted in both 2D and 3D scenarios, in which a pair of origin and destination places are typically hundreds of kilometers apart and 4 datasets of different scales including 500, 1,000, 1,500, and 2,000 candidate landmarks are randomly generated. A sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of different position drifting increments caused by external environment interferences, varying correction abilities, and heterogeneous landmark deployment costs on the solution behavior. The influence of the number of candidate landmarks, position error limit, and error increment rate on computing time is also evaluated. All these test results conclude that the algorithm is capable of finding in seconds the entire set of Pareto-optimal landmarks and paths in real-world applications.}

In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines tsunami flood and evacuation modelling with statistical analysis, to examine the pedestrian evacuation potential of 67 urban samples extracted from 12 case studies in Chile. Our findings show that urban form parameters like the number of exit points out of an endangered area, the mean distance from the street network to these points, and the population density, can have a noticeable impact on tsunami evacuation times, which nonetheless is significantly dependent on the evacuees’ departure time. Moreover, we demonstrate that Chilean urban coastal development has been noticeably carried out through grid-like form patterns that might contribute to hinder evacuation in case of a tsunami emergency.}

abstract = {Land surface albedo plays an important role in controlling the surface energy budget and regulating the biophysical processes of natural dynamics and anthropogenic activities. Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach to estimate surface albedo at regional and global scales. It nevertheless remains challenging for current satellites to capture fine-scale albedo variations due to their coarse spatial resolutions from tens to hundreds of meters. The emerging Sentinel-2 satellites, with a high spatial resolution of 10 m and an approximate 5-day revisiting cycle, provide a promising solution to address these observational limitations, yet their potentials remain underexplored. In this study, we integrated the Sentinel-2 observations with an updated direct estimation approach to improve the estimation and monitoring of fine-scale surface albedo. To enable the capability of the direct estimation approach at a 10-m scale, we combined the 10-m resolution European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover land cover data and the 500-m resolution Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/albedo product to build a high-quality and representative BRDF training database. To evaluate our approach, we proposed an integrated evaluation framework leveraging 3-D physical model simulations, ground measurements, and satellite observations. Specifically, we first simulated a comprehensive dataset of Sentinel-2-like surface reflectance and broadband albedo across a variety of geometric configurations using the MODIS BRDF training samples. With this dataset, we built the Look-Up-Tables (LUTs) that connect surface broadband albedo and Sentinel-2 reflectance through a direct angular bin-based linear regression approach, and further coupled these LUTs with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform. We next evaluated the proposed algorithm at two spatial levels: (1) 10-m scale for absolute accuracy assessment using the references from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) simulations and flux-site observations, and (2) 500-m scale for large-scale mapping assessment by comparing the estimated albedo with the MODIS albedo product. Lastly, we presented four examples to show the capability of Sentinel-2 albedo in detecting fine-scale characteristics of vegetation and urban covers. Results show that: (1) the proposed algorithm accurately estimates surface albedo from Sentinel-2-like reflectance across different landscape configurations (overall root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 0.018, bias = 0.005, and coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.88); (2) the Sentinel-2-derived surface albedo agrees well with ground measurements (overall RMSE = 0.030, bias = -0.004, and R2 = 0.94) and MODIS products (overall RMSE = 0.030, bias = 0.021, and R2 = 0.97); and (3) Sentinel-2-derived albedo accurately captures seasonal leaf phenology and rapid snow events, and detects the interspecific (or interclass) variations of tree species and colored urban rooftops. These results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to map high-resolution surface albedo from Sentinel-2 satellites over large spatial and temporal contexts, suggesting the potential of using such fine-scale datasets to improve our understanding of albedo-related biophysical processes in the coupled human-environment system.}

However, traditional continuous air quality monitoring systems are often costly and time-consuming in data treatment. Lately, there is a growing trend towards the use of low-cost wireless PM sensors, providing more detailed information than standard systems. This paper presents a system designed to measure air quality, specifically, a wireless sensor network composed of a distributed sensor network linked to a cloud system. The proposed system can efficiently measure air quality as it is cost-effective, small-sized, and consumes little power. Sensor nodes based on low-power long range (LoRa) motes transmit field measurement data to the cloud via a gateway, and a cloud computing system is implemented to store, monitor, process, and visualise the data. Advanced techniques were included in our cloud for data processing and analysis to optimise the detection of PM. Laboratory and field tests in the historic Riotinto mine validate the system's viability, offering real-time air quality information for nearby populations. Once calibrated, sensors demonstrate high accuracy, presenting mean error of −0.3% and low deviation (R2 = 0.96) when compared to regulatory systems for both low (<10 μgPM10/m3) and hazardous concentrations (300 μgPM10/m3), which makes them perfect as early warning systems for atmospheric pollution in mining.}

It is an effort to resolve the best feasible trajectory between the source and the destination while prohibiting collision in a dynamic environment. Many researchers have proposed different deterministic and non-deterministic solutions to the path-planning problem. However, it is still open to new promising methods to acquire better quality solutions with minimum time complexity. This article presents a novel methodology inspired by the Reverse Glowworm Swarm Optimization (RGSO) algorithm to resolve this problem for the UAV without colliding with any dynamic and static obstructions appearing in its path. A tuned path is generated after the initial one to optimize further and smoothen the trajectory. The proposed method has been extensively experimented with, and the outcomes show it outperforms the other algorithm in a three-dimensional dynamic environment in a path-planning strategy. The result shows that our proposed scheme reduces the value of the cost function by approximately 49% - 107% less than other existing approaches, and the execution time of this mechanism reduces by 2% - 61% compared with other existing methods. Thus, the proposed technique RGSO-UAV is an optimal and energy-efficient path-planning model in flying ad-hoc networks that enhance UAV's lifetime.}

abstract = {A number of key concepts have punctuated the development of Safety science. Reflecting on what the next ones could be is a tricky exercise. How come certain safety concepts or theories or dispositive in the sense of Foucault emerge and become ‘dominating concepts’ or turning points in safety science? The paper considers a case from the past, namely that of Safety Management System (SMS), as a proxy to shed light on this question. The origins of SMS are explored to unravel what lies behind its emergence and development. The research is based on a literature review and open-ended interviews of 15 people who played a personal part in safety science or practices development before and/or when SMS started to emerge. Overall, the sample of interviewees represents a range of safety stakeholders (academia, industry, regulatory bodies, consulting companies) and high-risk industries to provide a diversity of perspectives on the emergence of SMS. The analysis of this material highlights several aspects that contributed to converge towards an approach like the SMS, beyond the identified limitations of safety science at that time. First, the intellectual context in which SMS emerged, was that of major developments on organizational and managerial dimensions of safety. Second, most safety stakeholders had motivations beyond safety enhancement to move towards a new approach. Last, the overall environment, way beyond safety and high-risk industries, facilitated the convergence towards an approach like the SMS. Eventually, this research demonstrates that safety is a situated science, situated not only in time, but also in a much wider economic, industrial, political, societal context. Putting safety into such perspective opens new avenues for reflecting about the future of safety science considering current trends not only in safety but also way beyond.}

abstract = {Thaw slumps are clear indicators of rapid permafrost degradation. They form preferentially in near-surface ice-rich permafrost of northern high latitudes after initial thermal disturbance by the subsequent interplay of thermal (thawing of frozen deposits and melting of ice) and mechanical (slumping and erosion) processes. The largest known thaw slump on Earth – the Batagay megaslump – has been identified in sloping terrain on the Yana Upland in northern Yakutia. Its initiation began in the 1980s, with a current area of >0.8 km2. It continues to grow and has headwall retreat rates of up to 15 m per year. While various satellite remote sensing studies of the Batagay thaw slump have been undertaken, on-site studies characterizing internal landforms, terrain changes, and geomorphic processes have not yet been conducted. To fill this knowledge gap and to enhance our understanding of the dynamics of very large thaw slumps, our study employs on-site observations and detailed permafrost sampling combined with unoccupied aerial vehicle data from 2019. The latter were used to generate an orthomosaic, a digital surface model, hypsometric slope profiles and a map of relief types in the thaw slump. Within the Batagay thaw slump, the dynamic relationship between headwall morphology and slump floor is largely determined by the cryolithological structure of the permafrost horizons exposed across the headwall rising up to 55 m above the slump floor. Factors include the thickness and overall high volumetric ground-ice content (up to 87 %) of the cryostratigraphic horizons. Furthermore, the diurnal and seasonal insolation exposure of the headwall perimeter superimposes both thermal denudation activity and meltwater transport of eroded material. Thus, recent degradation patterns are linked to permafrost properties. Therefore, the Batagay thaw slump is not only a window into Earth's past as it reveals ancient permafrost, but its modern dynamics highlight that ongoing rapid permafrost thaw under present Arctic warming is directly influenced by its Quaternary geological and permafrost history.}

For better networking to have efficient communication in FANETs, we propose self-organization based clustering scheme inspired by the behavioral study of glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) for cluster formation and management. The cluster head election and cluster formation take place based on connectivity with the ground control station along with luciferin value and residual energy of the UAVs. The cluster management mechanism uses behavioral study of GSO by updating the luciferin value based on the UAVs’ position. Furthermore we propose a mechanism for route selection based on the neighbor range, residual energy and position of UAV for efficient communication. The performance of the proposed SOCS is evaluated in terms of energy consumption, cluster building time, cluster lifetime and probability of delivery success with other existing bio-inspired clustering schemes.}

Morphological operations were used to reduce shadow mask noise. The shadow masks are used in the process of removing shadows from the original images using the illumination ratio of the shadow/non-shadow regions.

This study proposes a novel, evidence-based framework (4-AIDE) that highlights the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based collaborative platforms in disaster, extreme weather and emergency situations. A qualitative approach underpinned by organizational information processing theory (OIPT) is employed to design, develop and conduct semi-structured interviews with 33 respondents having experience in AI and cloud computing industries during emergency and extreme weather situations. For analysing the collected data, axial, open and selective coding is used that further develop themes, propositions and an evidence-based framework. The study findings indicate that AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms offer a structured and logical approach to enable two-way, algorithm-based communication to collect, analyse and design effective management strategies for disaster and extreme weather situations. Managers of public systems or businesses can collect and analyse data to predict possible outcomes and take necessary actions in an extreme weather situation. Communities and societies can be more resilient by transmitting and receiving data to AI and cloud-based collaborative platforms. These actions can also help policymakers identify critical pockets and guide administration for their necessary preparation for unexpected, extreme weather, and emergency events.}

The restricted battery capacity of the UAVs, rapid mobility, and high dynamic nature of the UAVs necessities the design of energy efficient clustering and routing protocols. With its motivation, this paper develops an Energy Efficient Neuro-Fuzzy Cluster based Topology Construction with Metaheuristic Route Planning (EENFC-MRP) algorithm for UAVs. The presented model involves EENFC based clustering and MRP based routing processes. The EENFC model make use of three input parameters namely Residual Energy in UAV, Average Distance to Nearby UAVs, and UAV Degree for the cluster construction. In addition, Quantum Ant Lion Optimization (QALO) based MRP is applied to choose an optimal set of routes for intercluster UAV communication. In order to investigate the energy efficient outcome of the EENFC-MRP algorithm, a series of simulation processes were carried out and the results are examined under several aspects. The resultant experimental values ensured the betterment of the EENFC-MRP algorithm over the existing models interms of energy efficiency, throughput, network lifetime, and average delay.}

The Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) sensor provides near-global full-waveform LiDAR data with 25 m footprints, from which various structural metrics are derived that are used to predict footprint level AGBD. The current GEDI L4A AGBD product uses a comprehensive Forest Structure and Biomass Database (FSBD) to develop models for specific plant functional types and geographic regions, but southern African savannas have been underrepresented in the reference data. The objectives of this study were to (i) validate GEDI L4A AGBD in South African savannas using field measurements and ALS datasets and (ii) develop and evaluate local GEDI footprint-level AGBD estimates from multiple L2A and L2B metrics. The local GEDI AGBD models outperformed GEDI L4A AGBD (R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 12 Mg/ha, %RMSE = 79.5%) with higher R2 and smaller error measures. The local GEDI AGBD using a random forest model (RF) had the highest R2 of 0.71 and lowest %RMSE of 53.3%, while the generalized linear model (GLM) results provided the lowest Relative Mean Systematic Deviation (RMSD) of 9.2%, which was half that of RF model. L4A significantly underestimated AGBD with an RMSD up to −37%. This highlights the importance and benefits of local calibration of biomass models to unlock the full potential of GEDI metrics for estimating AGBD. The field and ALS data have subsequently been contributed to the GEDI FSBD and should be used in calibration of future versions of GEDI L4A AGBD product. This research paves the way for the integration of the local GEDI AGBD estimates with other sensors, notable the eminent NISAR mission, to derive regional to global gridded AGBD products that will enable the monitoring of savanna carbon stocks.}

Due to prevailing weather conditions and high emission density, this region is prone to the accumulation of air pollutants that often leads to severe haze events. In this study, we combined satellite and ground observations, and a regional air quality modeling system to quantify the contribution of open biomass burning to surface PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm) concentrations during a severe haze episode. During this period (November 1st - 4th, 2015), the average PM2.5 concentrations in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces reached 116.98 μg/m3, 98.60 μg/m3, and 70.17 μg/m3 respectively. Model simulations showed that open biomass burning contributed to 52.7% of PM2.5 concentrations over Northeast China. Using the differences in active fire spots as detected by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suites (VIIRS) aboard the Suomi-NPP, we estimated that the burning ban enforced in 2018 have caused the PM2.5 concentrations to decrease from the 2015 level by 67.10%, 53.23%, and 10.06% in the Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces respectively. Over the region, the burning ban proved to be effective in reducing fire emissions and lowering region-wide PM2.5 concentration by 48.1% during the post-harvest season.}

This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development. The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal changes during the night (for example from a geostationary platform or constellation of satellites), and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission (roughly analogous to the BRDF in daylight sensing). Perhaps most importantly, we make the case that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions, and monitor energy use.}

abstract = {Tundra fires are projected to increase with anthropogenic climate change, yet our ability to assess key wildfire metrics such as fire severity remains limited. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is the most commonly applied index for fire severity mapping. However, the computation of NBR depends on short-wave infrared (SWIR) data, which are not commonly available from historical and contemporary high-resolution (≤4 m) optical imagery. The increasing availability of visible near-infrared (VNIR) measurements from proximal to spaceborne sensors/platforms has the potential to advance our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of fire severity within tundra fires. Here we systematically assess the feasibility of using VNIR data for fire severity mapping in ten Alaskan tundra fires (cumulatively burned ~1700 km2). We compared the accuracy of 10 published VNIR-based fire indices using both uni-temporal (post-fire image) and bi-temporal (pre-fire and post-fire image difference) assessments against ground-based fire severity data (Composite Burn Index, CBI) at 109 tundra sites. The Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) had the highest correspondence with CBI (R2 = 0.77 uni-temporal; R2 = 0.85 bi-temporal), with similar performance to NBR (R2 = 0.77 uni-temporal; R2 = 0.83 bi-temporal). Tundra vegetation types affected NBR but not GEMI, as SWIR reflectance was influenced to a greater extent in shrub than graminoid tundra. We applied GEMI to contemporary high-resolution (i.e. Quickbird 2) and historical meso-resolution imagery (i.e. Landsat Multispectral Scanner) to demonstrate the capability of GEMI for resolving fine-scale patterns of fire severity and extending fire severity archives. Results suggest that GEMI accurately captured the heterogeneous patterns of tundra fire severity across fire seasons, ecoregions, and vegetation types.}

It is, therefore, important to understand how forest restoration treatments alter snowpack distribution and design the treatments accordingly. We use a combination of aerial lidar, multi-temporal terrestrial mobile lidar, and UAV photogrammetry to estimate rapidly changing snow depth and cover in northern Arizona, USA. We then examine the impact of forest structure and topography on snow depth and snow cover persistence to inform forest restoration treatments. Our results show that mobile lidar data can be used to estimate snow depth with standard errors of 8 cm when differenced with snow-off airborne lidar data. UAV-based Structure-from-Motion data can be used to estimate snow cover persistence with 92–97% overall accuracies in forested ecosystems. Random forest models indicate spatially varying importance of forest structural and topographic variables in predicting snow depth and cover persistence, when summarized at different spatial scales (from 5 m to 250 m) and with variable directional location offsets. Forest snow depth was best explained (R2 ≈ 0.46) by canopy height metrics at summary scales of >75 m, while canopy cover was most important at summary scales of <40 m (R2 ≈ 0.3). Snow cover persistence was best explained at very local scales by canopy cover (R2 ≈ 0.38) and less so at larger scales (>75 m) by topographic and forest patch characteristics (R2 ≈ 0.34). Our results demonstrate that 3-dimensional datasets are critical in rapidly characterizing changing snowpack to better understand the impacts of forest structure and topography to inform forest restoration treatment designs. The relationships observed in our study can inform currently ongoing regional-scale forest restoration in the southwest to improve forest health and resiliency.}

The study seeks to reshape dam safety components in the near future through a technical focus group discussion (FGD) with key stakeholders. Utilizing the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) dataset for the immediate future (2020–2040) under various scenarios (SSP1–2.6, SSP2–4.5, SSP3–7.0, and SSP5–8.5), historical Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall datasets (1981 to 2021) are employed. A multi-filtration process ranks twenty-three Global Climate Models (GCMs) using seven relative importance metrics (RIMs). This work's novelty lies in a focused GCM evaluation through individual contributions quantified with RIMs, providing a refined ranking that address the limitations of traditional metrics. Then, the Compromise Programming Index (CPI) aggregates the ranked models, with the top subset selected through Jenks Optimised Classification (JOC), identifying ACCESS-ESM1–5 and CMCC-ESM2 as top models. The selected GCMs were bias-corrected using the linear scaling method and validated before ensembled, effectively replicating the probability distribution function (PDF) of CHIRPS data, as confirmed by a Taylor diagram indicating the closest agreement. The study reveals a generally wetter tendency in the northernmost area of Machap dam under all SSPs, with 5–9 % maximum increasing percentages. Conversely, downstream areas anticipate decreasing rainfall. June (6–22 %) and July (7–22 %) project higher rainfall, indicating increased water availability in a relatively dry period, while December (3–11 %) suggests increasing flood risk. The South West monsoon (SWM) anticipates lower rainfall in early March (3–7 %) and more severe dry periods in August (8–11 %). Future drought occurrences are projected homogeneously across scenarios, with drought months ranging from 15 % to 19 % of the 252 months under all severity classifications. In particular, the study enhances myDAMS by proposing continuous development of the guideline under diverse scenario for Machap dam's overall management and sustainability. Projected scenarios, coupled with outcomes from FGD, can inform basin-scale dam management, aiding risk mitigation for critical dam infrastructure.}

In addition to fire events, contemporary firefighters respond to an increasing volume of non-fire incidents. Thus, this study aims to identify firefighters' SA during three fire incidents (single house fire, vehicle fire, and passenger aircraft fire) and three non-fire incidents (medical emergency, hazardous materials, and urban search and rescue). A goal-directed task analysis was conducted via focus group discussions with eight career firefighters. Findings indicate that firefighters build their SA by processing various cues from hazards (e.g., fire, ignition source), humans (e.g., occupants, bystanders, drivers, passengers), spatial elements (e.g., building structure, location of hazards), and surrounding conditions (e.g., traffic, weather). Our findings provide insights into SA measurement, SA-oriented work processes, training for SA, and designing technologies to support firefighters' SA during all-hazard responses.}

abstract = {Social media was underutilised in disaster management practices, as it was not seen as a real-time ground level information harvesting tool during a disaster. In recent years, with the increasing popularity and use of social media, people have started to express their views, experiences, images, and video evidences through different social media platforms. Consequently, harnessing such crowdsourced information has become an opportunity for authorities to obtain enhanced situation awareness data for efficient disaster management practices. Nonetheless, the current disaster-related Twitter analytics methods are not versatile enough to define disaster impacts levels as interpreted by the local communities. This paper contributes to the existing knowledge by applying and extending a well-established data analysis framework, and identifying highly impacted disaster areas as perceived by the local communities. For this, the study used real-time Twitter data posted during the 2010–2011 South East Queensland Floods. The findings reveal that: (a) Utilising Twitter is a promising approach to reflect citizen knowledge; (b) Tweets could be used to identify the fluctuations of disaster severity over time; (c) The spatial analysis of tweets validates the applicability of geo-located messages to demarcate highly impacted disaster zones.}

A range of scientific methods for developing scenarios is available, but we argue that they have limited capacity to investigate complex social-ecological futures because: 1) non-linear change is rarely incorporated and: 2) they rarely involve co-evolutionary dynamics of integrated social-ecological systems. This manuscript intends to address these two concerns by applying the method of science fiction prototyping to developing scenarios for the future of global fisheries in a changing global ocean. We used an empirically informed background on existing and emerging trends in marine natural resource use and dynamics to develop four ‘radical ocean futures,' incorporating and extrapolating from existing environmental, technological, social and economic trends. We argue that the distinctive method as applied here can complement existing scenario methodologies and assist scientists in developing a holistic understanding of complex systems dynamics. The approach holds promise for making scenarios more accessible and interesting to non-academics and can be useful for developing proactive governance mechanisms.}

Although these companies have been developing programs to mitigate the impacts caused by COVID-19, researchers have been worried about a possible weakening of the adoption of sustainable initiatives due to a focus on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic. Grounded on the Resource Orchestration Theory, the goal of this study was to assess the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on sustainable (environmental, social, and economic) performance in the context of agri-food supply chains. To do so, a questionnaire survey was used to collect data from 349 different medium and large agri-food companies in Brazil. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares technique. This study has found out that, under the impacts arising from COVID-19 pandemic (1) supply management and transportation and logistics management had a positive impact on food supply chains' sustainable performance; (2) the effects of relationship management and supply chain wide impact management were found to be negative on sustainable performance; and (3) the effects of demand and production management on sustainable performance were not considered significant. We propose a framework that clearly represents the relationship between the disrupted supply chain areas and sustainable performance through the development of orchestration capabilities. By knowing which kinds of impacts produce the most significant effects on sustainable performance, policy makers and managers will be able to make decisions and take actions to avoid negative effects and to improve firms’ sustainable performance.}

Although post-fire debris flow exhibits time evolution, the key factors controlling its evolution remain unclear. A detailed field investigation, rainfall data collection and remote sensing analysis were conducted to study the debris flow events following the “3.08” forest fire in Xiangjiao gully. The destructive effect of forest fires, the control factors and inherent evolution mechanism of post-fire debris flow were explored. The results highlight that the great disturbance of forest fires to the hydrological response and material source supply conditions promote the outbreak of debris flows. In the rapid response stage of fire, the internal driving force of debris flow evolution is the self-healing of hydrological response characteristics of the basin, including material depletion, particle coarsening and vegetation restoration. In the long-term impact stage, the evolution of debris flows is mainly controlled by factors such as a decrease in root-soil strength caused by root rot, multi-stage gully bank landslide activity, and blockage of woody debris. A conceptual model for the evolution of post-fire debris flows is proposed based on the above evolution characteristic analysis. In particularly, this study emphasizes the catastrophic effect of woody debris during the evolution of post-fire debris flows. The research results provide scientific basis for long-term debris flow risk assessment and mitigation design in recently burnt areas.}

Land-cover classification maps of the Arctic regions are essential for monitoring and change detection purposes, as well as upscaling of various ecosystem processes. However, large-scale land cover maps of the Arctic regions are often too coarse to properly capture the heterogeneity of these landscapes. In this study, we bridge this gap through incorporating multi temporal Landsat-8 OLI data in a large-scale land cover classification, and subsequently produce a tundra classification map for the entire Greenland. An algorithm is developed that allows for the extraction of vegetation phenology from single-year time series of 4169 OLI scenes at 30 m resolution despite the low revisit frequency of the satellite and persistent cloud cover. The phenological metrics, satellite-derived wetness, and terrain information are then used to separate land surface classes using a random forest classifier. The optimal algorithm parameters and input layers are identified, ultimately yielding a cross-validation accuracy of 89.25% across the studied area. Finally, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis on the resulting land-cover map and for the first time presented the geographical distribution, latitudinal gradients, and climate linkages of the various tundra vegetation classes across the ice-free part of Greenland. With a resolution of 30 m and Greenland-wide spatial coverage, the produced land-cover map can support various applications at scales ranging from the landscape to regional level.}

abstract = {On 17 March 2018 major grassland fires in south-west Victoria, Australia ignited several peat bogs. The peat fires smouldered for 40 days, generating substantial amounts of smoke. The surrounding communities were exposed to significant concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5), resulting in the need for active interventions (such as the relocation of schools) in order to protect vulnerable communities. The peat fires provided a unique opportunity to review the capabilities of two air pollution forecasting models to assess the impact from the peat fires on nearby communities: the Air Quality Forecasting System (AQFx) and the Accident Reporting and Guiding Operational System (ARGOS) Both systems are used in Victoria to inform emergency management response strategies and community warnings. A key configuration change was made to the smoke emissions module in AQFx from simulating emissions from a planned burn to a sub-surface peat fire. Emissions were derived by using heat maps generated from aerial imagery data and estimates of fuel load determined by the peat bulk density and depth of the peat. The results indicated that AQFx successfully captured most smoke plume events during the simulation period, despite some errors in timing and magnitude. Accurate forecasting was most challenged by calm conditions, and meso-scale meteorological transition events. The ARGOS model performed better at capturing the smoke plume dispersion during a meso-scale meteorological transition event due to meteorological forecasts being updated every 6 hours compared to a 24-h update in AQFx. However, the source geometry in ARGOS meant that emission rates were concentrated within a small number of release points resulting in relatively narrow plumes with a likely overprediction of higher end PM2.5 concentrations. The AQFx system was better suited to area emissions. The ARGOS and AQFx models showed different strengths in providing timely information to emergency response agencies to better manage smoke impacts from smouldering peat fires on communities. The ARGOS model can be set up quickly with preliminary emission estimates that can be adjusted as more accurate and updated information becomes available. Compared to the ARGOS model, AQFx is better suited for area emissions. Implementation of a rapid update cycle in AQFx would further improve forecasts especially during meteorological transition events.}

Due to climate change, conditions of high ignition propensity are becoming more frequent, leading to an increased need for the development of alternative fire prevention systems that can mitigate the consequences of fire incidents. In this context, this work explores thermal imaging data for early detection of fire outbreaks, aiming for application in a real context. To that end, experimental trials were conducted in laboratory and at the venue of a summer festival under real operation conditions. The datasets acquired are characterized in detail, and a feature engineering process is devised for the analysis of the response of thermal imaging sensors to a fire ignition. To deal with high-dimensional data, the feature construction method follows a statistical color-based approach, that characterizes the dynamic changes in the data using three features. Subsequently, this paper proposes a fuzzy modeling approach based on these variables, which is transparent to interpretation and enables the assessment of patterns modeled. The performance of the classification algorithm for detection of fire outbreaks is evaluated and framed with works in the state-of-the-art for this application.}

abstract = {The path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) formations plays a crucial role in mountainous forest monitoring missions. However, path planning is particularly challenging due to steep terrain and dense vegetation, making it difficult to generate optimal flight paths. The goal of UAV formation path planning in forest monitoring is to create safe, feasible flight paths for each UAV, avoiding terrain obstacles and ensuring coordination and safety, ultimately improving the quality of mission accomplishment. This study establishes a mathematical model that incorporates multiple constraints, such as flight distance, collision threats, and path stability, effectively transforming the complex problem of UAV formation path planning into an optimization problem. To address this multi-constraint path planning optimization problem, an Artificial Rabbit Optimization algorithm incorporating Reinforcement Learning and Thermal conduction search strategy (RLTARO) is proposed. The incorporation of multiple strategies aims to improve the balance of exploration and exploitation of the algorithms as well as algorithmic convergence in the face of complex path planning problems. The comprehensive comparison of the RLTARO algorithm with nine advanced algorithms of similar type in the CEC2017 suite demonstrates its outstanding convergence and robustness across various types of optimization problems. The results of path planning experiments conducted on six mountainous forest terrains with varying complexities demonstrate that RLTARO can efficiently and reliably plan flight paths for UAV formations. Furthermore, the Friedman test results from multiple experiments consistently indicate that RLTARO holds significant performance advantages over the comparison algorithms.}

Post classification change detection techniques were then used to analyse the changes that had occurred over the study period. It was observed that about 37.63% of the closed canopy forests have been converted to the other covers types. The findings showed that the forest estates in the District, which was one of the richest in the High forests in terms of species diversity and richness, had been severely degraded. This could have dire implications on biodiversity, carbon sequestration and livelihood of fringe communities. Concurrent restoration of degraded forest cover and integration of remote sensing and spatial analysis techniques into routine forestry management practices at both District and National levels would provide an effective mechanism to curb the high rate of forests depletion in Ghana.}

When tackled during a stringent economic era, the allocation of resources to efficiently deal with such disaster situations (e.g., brigades, vehicles and other support equipment for fire events) undergoes severe budgetary limitations which, in several proven cases, have lead to personal casualties due to a reduced support equipment. As such, the lack of enough communication resources to cover the disaster area at hand may cause a risky radio isolation of the deployed teams and ultimately fatal implications, as occurred in different recent episodes in Spain and USA during the last decade. This issue becomes even more dramatic when understood jointly with the strong budget cuts lately imposed by national authorities. In this context, this article postulates cost-efficient multi-hop communications as a technological solution to provide extended radio coverage to the deployed teams over disaster areas. Specifically, a Harmony Search (HS) based scheme is proposed to determine the optimal number, position and model of a set of wireless relays that must be deployed over a large-scale disaster area. The approach presented in this paper operates under a Pareto-optimal strategy, so a number of different deployments is then produced by balancing between redundant coverage and economical cost of the deployment. This information can assist authorities in their resource provisioning and/or operation duties. The performance of different heuristic operators to enhance the proposed HS algorithm are assessed and discussed by means of extensive simulations over synthetically generated scenarios, as well as over a more realistic, orography-aware setup constructed with LIDAR (Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging) data captured in the city center of Bilbao (Spain).}

Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) is presently in continuous development at a rapid pace. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or more extensively Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are platforms considered under the RPAs paradigm. Simultaneously, the development of sensors and instruments to be installed onboard such platforms is growing exponentially. These two factors together have led to the increasing use of these platforms and sensors for remote sensing applications with new potential. Thus, the overall goal of this paper is to provide a panoramic overview about the current status of remote sensing applications based on unmanned aerial platforms equipped with a set of specific sensors and instruments. First, some examples of typical platforms used in remote sensing are provided. Second, a description of sensors and technologies is explored which are onboard instruments specifically intended to capture data for remote sensing applications. Third, multi-UAVs in collaboration, coordination, and cooperation in remote sensing are considered. Finally, a collection of applications in several areas are proposed, where the combination of unmanned platforms and sensors, together with methods, algorithms, and procedures provide the overview in very different remote sensing applications. This paper presents an overview of different areas, each independent from the others, so that the reader does not need to read the full paper when a specific application is of interest}

During the last decade, there has been a growing focus of research in the UAV's assistance paradigm as a fundamental concept resulting in the constant improvement between different kinds of ground networks and the hovering UAVs in the sky. Recently, the wide availability of embedded wireless interfaces in the communicating entities has allowed the deployment of such a paradigm simpler and easiest. Moreover, due to UAVs' controlled mobility and adjustable altitudes, they can be considered as the most appropriate candidate to enhance the performance and overcome the restrictions of ground networks. This comprehensive survey both studies and summarizes the existing UAV-assisted research, such as routing, data gathering, cellular communications, Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and disaster management that supports existing enabling technologies. Descriptions, classifications, and comparative studies related to different UAV-assisted proposals are presented throughout the paper. By pointing out numerous future challenges, it is expected to simulate research in this emerging and hot research area. To the best of our knowledge, there are many survey papers on the topic from a technology perspective. Nevertheless, this survey can be considered as the first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of different types of existing UAV-assisted networks and describes the state-of-the-art in UAV-assisted research.}

Data on mangrove extent prior to the early 1990s is scarce, contributing to uncertainties in long-term trend analyses. Recent estimates (since 2010) have reported widely varying mangrove extents from 2000 km² to 3400 km², indicating large uncertainties in current trends. Leveraging five decades of Landsat satellite data, this study offers a methodologically consistent approach to classify Madagascar's mangrove extent, providing a comprehensive dataset from 1972, 1989, 1999, 2009, to 2019. Our findings reveal an overall decrease of 8 % from 2935 km² in 1972–2699 km² in 2019, with loss rates decelerating from 0.4 % per year in the initial period to 0.2 % per year post-1999. This decline primarily reflects anthropogenic pressures, notably in the northern regions. Conversely, the last decade has witnessed a 5 % increase in mangrove coverage, primarily in the central and southern regions, thanks to concerted conservation and reforestation efforts, highlighting a positive shift in mangrove management and protection strategies. This study's long-term perspective is crucial for understanding the dynamics of mangrove coverage and guiding effective intervention strategies in Madagascar.}

The aim of the resulting Safe Mission Manager System is to autonomously adapt to contingency events while still achieving mission objectives through the degradation of mission performance. In this paper, we discuss some of the architectural issues in designing this system. The resulting architecture makes a conceptual differentiation between event monitoring, decision-making on a policy for dealing with contingencies and the execution of the corresponding policy. We also discuss how to allocate the different Safe Mission Manager components to a partitioned, Integrated Modular Avionics architecture. Finally, determinism and predictability are key aspects in contingency management due to their overall impact on safety. For this reason, we model and verify the correctness of a contingency management policy using formal methods.}

abstract = {Low-lying Bangladesh is known as one of the most flood-prone countries in the world. During the last few decades, the frequency, intensity, and duration of floods have increased. To ensure safety and save lives when people's homes submerge because of flooding, it is urgent to relocate them to safe shelters during the flooding. In Bangladesh, the number of designated flood shelters is very less. To plan and prioritise the building of shelters, flood hazard zonation and the identification of suitable locations for shelters are vital for disaster risk mitigation. This study attempted the first and most extensive national flood inundation database and flood dynamics of Bangladesh developed between 2017 and 2020 using public domain Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were processed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and replicable methodology. Using a set of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) criteria associated with flood disasters (e.g., floods recurrence areas), elevation, land cover, landform, population density, accessibility, distance to road, and distance to settlement layers were used to identify the hazard zones and the safest locations for building flood shelters. The study assessed that 7.11% of the area was inundated by overflow water in June 2017 and 8.99% in August 2017. Similarly, in June, July, and August 2018; June, July and August 2019, and July 2020, with inundation covering 7.26%, 10.87%, 11.07%, 9.50%, 10.56%, 5.01% and 11.14% of the country, respectively. The results show that extremely-high flood prone areas cover about 13% of Bangladesh. Analysis of the suitability of flood shelters shows that about 8% is extremely-high suitable, 16% is very-high suitable, and 7% is very-low suitability for flood shelters. The flood suitability and flood hazard maps would be helpful to support the local government, national and international organisations for flood disaster risk minimisation and the planning and construction of flood shelters.}

Fire has a significant impact on the soil, and it is therefore necessary to understand how controlled burns affect this invaluable resource. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the main alterations in the physical-chemical and biological properties of the soil because of a high intensity-controlled burn in “Los Boquerones” area (Villaviciosa de Córdoba, Spain). Additionally, we assessed the spatial heterogeneity of the alterations of different soil properties. A grid of 12 points was established on a hillside in Sierra Morena (Córdoba). Thermocouples were placed at each point, and soil samples were collected at two depths (0–2 cm and 2–5 cm) before burning, immediately after burning and eight months later. Soil pH, electrical conductivity, nutrient content and/or availability, among others, and their spatio-temporal variations were analysed. Soil pH, increased in the first centimetres of the soil (0–2 cm) immediately after burning up to >2 units, and the increase was maintained eight months following the burn. Additionally, the high-intensity burn had a positive short-term effect on some of the soil properties, such as nutrient availability for plants, which was considerably increased. The magnitude of the alterations in the soil indicators assessed was spatially explained by the behaviour of the fire during the controlled burning. The burn also had both direct and indirect effects on soil microorganisms. In conclusion, the possible immediate and short-term effects of burning on the soil resource should be considered for a more holistic management of fire in forest ecosystems, as its functionality and capacity to provide ecosystem services is largely altered by these events as a function of their intensity.}

One of the reasons for this situation is the fact that domain-specific abstractions, which are a major underpinning of digitalization in general, have so far received very little attention. This is particularly a major obstacle for the digitalization of the work area of corporate environmental compliance management (CECM), which is intended to ensure that the firm complies with environmental legislation. Using general system theory, the CECM area is analyzed, and a set of domain-specific abstractions is proposed. Further contributions of the article are focused on two crucial CECM decision tasks: the relevance assessment of environmental regulations and the determination of compliance enforcement measures. Based on the abstractions, decision schemes and tailored domain-specific templates of decision trees for these tasks are suggested and demonstrated through a running example. It is expected that through these novel building blocks, this research contributes to an advancement of the digitalization of CECM processes and of sustainability management in general. For example, the proposed building blocks may serve as a foundation for the development of compliance management information systems that offer smart assistance for CECM tasks. Digital assistance may mitigate deficiencies in CECM expertise and CECM experience, which are often imposed in practice by tight budget constraints.}

To date, efforts to do this have been rare, especially in large rivers, as they require appropriate tools for quantifying habitat heterogeneity with fine-scale resolution across broad spatial extents. In this study, we used side-scan sonar technology to map riverbed substrate at six sites in the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers. Substrate maps were then analyzed and visualized using geospatial analysis to relate fine-grained spatial substrate patterns to process domain structure. Our findings revealed two distinct nested domains of substrate patchiness, suggesting that different factors are responsible for shaping patterns of substrate at different scales. Although small-scale patchiness in substrate was likely driven by internal, or autogenic, physical processes, patterns at larger segment extents (>3 km) were often driven by abrupt transitions in habitat related to exogenous factors such as lateral erosion of talus, tributary inputs, and bank armoring. Additionally, we found that heterogeneity in benthic substrate increased with spatial extent at all of our study sites; however, this relationship was lower in the Missouri River, which is altered by impoundment. Our study represents one of the first efforts to relate benthic habitat heterogeneity to nested process domain structure in large riverscapes, and offers a unique perspective for linking landscape processes, geomorphological habitat heterogeneity, and biological structure and function in large rivers.}

This Special Issue illustrates the current knowledge of plant life in campo rupestre, a megadiverse, highly-endemic vegetation complex, and one under alarming and unprecedented threats. The major research areas grouping the 27 contributions to the Special Issue are: i) plant diversity, ii) species coexistence, regeneration niche and climate change, iii) ecology of species interactions, iv) plant life on canga, and v) fire, regeneration ecology, and conservation. We highlight knowledge gaps in plant life in campo rupestre and suggest priority avenues of future research and steps forward to understand and preserve ancient ecosystems worldwide. Such efforts include the need to: 1) better assess the ecology of herbaceous species, 2) understand the effects of global change drivers on the vulnerability of endemic species, 3) understand how plant functional diversity and plant–animal interactions shape community structure and function, 4) apply new technologies (cameras, drones and remote sensing proxies) to understand plant phenology in space and time, 5) unravel diversification patterns and distinguish paleoendemism from neoendemism, 6) to disentangle the ecological and evolutionary role of fire, 7) gain insight into the factors that limit ecological restoration in degraded campo rupestre, 8) increase awareness and value of ecosystem services, 9) identify essential variables, key measures and areas to conserve campo rupestre, 10) promote reviews and research comparing old ecosystems. Therefore, burgeoning literature on campo rupestre will benefit from long-term multi- and trans-disciplinary research investigating a wide array of topics, from plant ecology to ecosystem functioning to biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. All knowledge must reach stakeholders, and it should be translated into an ecosystem services assessment for guiding the rational stewardship of campo rupestre and for benefiting local people. A key step forward in the understanding of plant life in campo rupestre is the OCBIL Theory (old, climatically-buffered, infertile landscapes), which provides a theoretical framework of testable hypotheses and cross-continental comparisons. We anticipate this Special Issue will foster collaborative research leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of one of the world’s most ancient ecosystems.}

This study applied extensive multiple regression modeling of trail soil loss to identify influential factors that managers can manipulate to improve the sustainability of trail design and management. Field measurements assessed soil loss as the mean vertical depth along 135 trail transects across the Appalachian Trail sampled along three 5 km trail segments in New Hampshire’s White Mountains National Forest, chosen due to its exceptionally high use and impact. GIS and LiDAR data were used to create many new variables reflecting terrain characteristics that were expected to influence trail erosion and improve predictive models of trail system soil loss. A variety of terrain and hydrology characteristics were applied to model trail soil loss at three spatial scales: transect, trail corridor, and watershed. The model for each spatial scale and a combined model are presented. The adjusted R2 explaining variation in soil loss is 0.57 using variables from all spatial scales, improving on predictive modeling from earlier studies. Environmental and trail design factors such as slope and watershed flow length were found to be significantly correlated to soil loss and have implications for improved sustainable trail design and management.}

However, the high-speed mobility of UAVs, limited energy, and dynamically changing topology have led to critical challenges for the reliability of communication between UAVs, especially when designing routing schemes in FANET. In this paper, we introduce a Mobility-based Weighted Cluster Routing Scheme (MWCRSF) for FANET performance enhancement within the constraints of network resources. MWCRSF utilizes the high-level search efficiency of the Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and a new clustering algorithm based on SSA is first proposed to set up the initial UAV clusters. A weighted sum-based algorithm is then proposed for Cluster Head (CH) selection, where the residual energy, node correlation degree, relative mobility, distance to the Base Station (BS), and average distance are adopted as the selection criteria. To keep the UAV clusters updated, an efficient cluster maintenance algorithm is proposed as well. In order to provide timely and reliable data transmission to the BS, the optimal next-hop route selection is performed considering the link lifetime, residual energy, and distance between nodes and BS. We exploit the power of skyline operators in multi-criteria decision-making to reduce the search space and improve the efficiency of CH selection and next-hop routing. The simulation results reveal that the proposed MWCRSF scheme outperforms the existing methods under different metrics including cluster lifetime, energy efficiency, throughput, and network lifetime.}

In this paper, we presented the development process, main contents, significance, and limitations of the 3rd Adaptation Plan as a helpful case for the international community to consult in formulating their national adaptation plans. The plan aims to implement a climate-safe nation with the people, and its development process features a scientific evidence basis and participation of various parties. It systematically and organically recommends 232 measures to be implemented by the Korean government and related departments for the next five years to enhance the adaptive capacity to 84 climate risks. Through expert forums, working council on climate change adaptation, adaptation governance forums, online public hearings, and discussion on preparing public-oriented countermeasures, 41 representative public-oriented tasks in eight sectors were selected. The plan consists of measures to resolve national climate risks constructed based on scientific evidence. All adaptation parties participated in the entire process of establishing the adaptation plan and evaluating its implementation. Significantly, the 3rd Adaptation Plan attempts to overcome the limitations of the 2nd adaptation plan by planning for the operation of a citizen evaluation group. However, the plan's limitations have been identified as insufficient willingness to monitor and implement measures, differences in the spectrum of adaptation measures by a government department, and lack of publicity in the English language. The measures to deal with these shortcomings are being sought.}

abstract = {Sediment transport (bedload and suspension) plays a relevant role in the morphological response of river channels to large floods. Sediment load controls erosion and aggradation patterns during high flows, drives the migration of macroforms and contributes to the definition of thresholds for bank erosion and channel instability. Given this influence on channel morphology, it is clear that sediment transport influences both the channel geometry and water stage reached during floods and should therefore be considered in flood hazard analysis. So far, however, legislation on flood hazard and flood management plans still continues to typically disregard sediment transport. This is due mainly to the paucity of available data on sediment transport and the lack of standardized approaches for its integration into flood hazard analysis. The present work, which aims to provide some guidance on how to advance in this issue, has undertaken a bibliometric study and thorough review of the published scientific literature that had previously addressed the implications of sediment transport on flood hazards assessment. This review showed that: i) most studies on the influence of sediment transport on flood risk have focused on mountain streams, as they are highly sensitive systems to changes in sediment supply; ii) research has also focused on explaining historical changes in channel-conveyance capacity and flood frequency based on long-term trends in sediment supply; and iii) recent developments in hydrodynamic and morphodynamic numerical models provide opportunities to explicitly incorporate sediment transport in flood hazard analysis. However, despite the recent advances, we have identified important challenges and discussed needs to better consider sediment transport in flood hazards at different spatial and temporal scales.}

However, given mixed empirical support, the generality of the pyrodiversity hypothesis remains questionable. Here, we use a simulation experiment to explore the effects of spatiotemporal fire patterns on the population trajectories of four mammal species in a northern Australian savanna: northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus), northern brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula arnhemensis), grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni), and northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus). Underpinned by data from a landscape-scale fire experiment, we simulated mammal population trajectories under three scenarios of fire size (ambient, small/dispersed fires, large/clumped fires) and three levels of dispersal ability (low, moderate, high) over a 21-year period across the Kapalga area of Kakadu National Park. The simulated population size of all four species declined markedly, regardless of fire spatial pattern and dispersal ability. However, the predicted final population size (i.e. number of individuals in the final timestep of the simulation) for the northern brown bandicoot, northern brushtail possum and grassland melomys were significantly influenced by fire size, with declines most severe under the small/dispersed fire scenario. Our results suggest that maximising the dispersion of small fires at the expense of disturbance refugia (such as less-frequently burnt areas) may exacerbate the severity of mammal decline. This highlights the importance of considering trade-offs between spatial (i.e. fire dispersion) and temporal (i.e. fire frequency) aspects of pyrodiversity, and the potential risks when applying fire management for biodiversity conservation without a firm understanding of the requirements of the target species.}

The digital divide between people in the unequal distribution of skills and access to technological means and tools remains an essential future challenge, especially with vulnerable people in a crisis. Issues of fairness and inclusivity need great attention in the application of these technologies in crises or disasters in order not to overlook such vulnerable people. The failure in critical infrastructures (e.g., energy and communications) seems to increase risks and exacerbate the situation of vulnerable people in crises.

Specifically, the proposed multi-methodological approach integrates a syncretic risk perception conceptual model with a household-based group utility evolution model. The dynamics of household evacuation route choice are explored in two stages, namely the individual utility initiation and accommodation. The unique feature of the proposed approach is that it links individual risk perception, survival psychology, and group behavioral dynamics together to characterize household decision-making about choosing the evacuation routes. An empirical study coupled with experiments is conducted to help validate the proposed household evacuation route choice behavior model. Through various designed disaster scenarios, the applicability and strengths of the proposed model for mass evacuation planning and management are demonstrated. Particularly, the mean relative prediction errors of the proposed model with respect to household-based evacuation route switching probability and path flow splits are 3.79% and 6.88%, respectively, all within an acceptable range of ±10 %. This demonstrates that the proposed model and analytical results align closely with household choice behavior.}

However, baseline metrics to gauge pollinator health in the wild amidst rapid climate change are lacking. Our laboratory-based study establishes a baseline for pollinator physiological state by exploring how osmotic conditions influence survivorship in a desert hawkmoth pollinator, Manduca sexta. We sampled hemolymph osmolality from over 1000 lab-grown moths at 20 %, 50 %, and 80 % ambient humidity levels. Starved moths maintained healthy osmolality of 350–400 mmol/kg for 1–3 days after eclosion regardless of ambient humidity, but it sharply rose to 550 mmol/kg after 4–5 days in low and moderate humidity, and after 5 days in high humidity. Starved moths in low humidity conditions perished within 5 days, while those in high humidity survived twice as long. Moths fed synthetic Datura wrightii nectar, synthetic Agave palmeri nectar, or water, maintained osmolality within a healthy range of 350–400mmol/kg. The same was true for moths fed authentic floral nectars from Datura and Agave plants, although moths consumed more synthetic than authentic nectars, possibly due to non-sugar constituents. Simulating a 4-day mismatch between pollinator emergence and nectar availability, a single nectar meal osmotically rescued moths under dry ambient conditions. Our findings highlight hemolymph osmolality as a rapid and accurate biomarker distinguishing dehydrated from hydrated states in insect pollinators.}

Few applications exist in fisheries science. A rigorous methodology was applied to draw potential areas for future research on diadromous fishes circa 2030 that could be useful to a broader audience of European fisheries scientists. Diadromous fishes are species that migrate between fresh waters and the sea to complete their life cycle. First, twenty drivers were identified and fell within the scope of (i) diadromous fish conservation, (ii) their place and roles in modern societies, (iii) the main features of the world of science and research, and (iv) the main characteristics of research activities on this biological group. Past and future driver developments (i.e. retrospective analysis and hypotheses respectively) were examined. Then, the combination of drivers’ hypotheses within each of the four components listed above led to micro-scenarios describing how the components could plausibly change in the next fifteen years. Finally, global scenarios were obtained by juxtaposing four micro-scenarios, one for each of the components. Challenges that were identified from these global scenarios were mostly structural, intellectual with frequent revisions of theoretical and unchallenged concepts and ethical, and can be useful to better inform future changes in priorities and focus areas, technical investments, and funding opportunities operated by laboratories or individual researchers working on diadromous fishes. Also, this case study exploring the role of foresight in guiding research, particularly the part on the methodological description, could be of relevance for researchers in general.}

This study investigated changes in fire season pattern (i.e., the number of separate periods of a year when wildfires are most likely to ignite, spread, and affect resources) and the contributions of climate change in Daxing'anling, Northeast China. An expanded fire dataset in both spatial and temporal converge from ground reporting was used. A comparison with satellite detected burned areas showed good agreement in spring, summer, and entire fire season. The results showed that the number of fires used to appear in a bimodal pattern with spring and fall peaks in the last century, but transitioned to a unimodal pattern peaked in summer in this century. This conversion was mainly resulted from a remarkable increase in summer lightning fires, which was in turned associated with warming in Daxing'anling. Another factor for the conversion was decreased spring nonlightning fire occurrence in the northwest subregion, where the conversion was the most significant. This decrease of fire was mainly associated with increased precipitation. The analysis of a compositional fire series, built as the log of the ratio of lightning to nonlightning fires, suggests that climate change was a major factor for the conversion of fire season pattern. The finding from this study indicates a need to adjust the fire prevention implementation timeline by including summer fires and to develop strategies to reduce the related risks to firefighter safety and forest ecosystem health in Daxing'anling.}

abstract = {Chile is a global biodiversity hotspot and hosts a large proportion of the southern hemisphere’s temperate forests. The Chilean Valdivian temperate forest is a vulnerable ecosystem containing a highly ecologically valuable species assemblage. Productive forest plantations have involved deforestation of, and alien species introduction into, this ecosystem. This process has already severely impacted the western part of Chile (the Coastal Range) and is now occurring in the eastern part (the Andes), with forestry plantations promoted by government subsidies between 1974 and 2012. Archive Landsat satellite imagery classification and Google Earth Engine are used to assess land cover change over a 31-year period with a focus on alien species (Pinaceae and Eucalyptus spp.) spread and native (Nothofagus spp. and Araucaria araucana) deforestation. Results show a clear land cover pattern based on elevation: a higher altitude, relatively undisturbed area dominated by native forest (the Andes), and a lower altitude area where most human activity and related land covers are located (the valley area). The valley is highly dynamic because of constant land cover change due to forestry. Overall, Araucaria araucana cover has decreased over the study period, while Nothofagus spp. has remained relatively stable. Alien Pinaceae has decreased, while Eucalyptus spp. has remained stable. However, the results indicate that change analysis over long periods conceal dynamism. For example, Eucalyptus spp. sharply decreased between the 1980s and the 1990s and surged afterwards. Also, even though Nothofagus spp. cover dominates throughout the study period, change analysis shows a high degree of change in the valley area, indicating newly established Nothofagus spp. patches. Over the study period, long rotation Pinaceae plantations for timber have given way to shorter rotation forestry (alien Eucalyptus spp., native Nothofagus spp.) for pulp and local uses resulting from discontinuation of forest subsidies. In the absence of subsidies, only large-scale plantations can engage in long rotation forestry, as smallholders need the more stable income provided by shorter rotation forestry. Although higher elevations (the Andes) are dominated by native forest, several abandoned alien forest plantations may be the source of biological invasion. In addition, native forest degradation as a result of Araucaria araucana loss and shrub encroachment is occurring. Earth observation methods are key for forest and alien species monitoring and landscape management. They can enhance traditional, ground-based forest surveys and provide continuous and even retrospective monitoring of forest change thanks to the wide availability of current and historical satellite data.}

Healthcare and social reforms will likely be necessary in the coming decades to address structural issues with retirement, socio-economic inequality, and the high cost of healthcare. In the meantime, AI-enabled smart technologies and environments are being rapidly developed to assist overwhelmed caretakers, enable access to healthcare providers, address isolation and depression among older adults, and provide mobility to and from essential services in sprawling suburbs and rural areas. This study utilizes a participatory, intuitive logics approach to construct scenarios of aging in smart environments in 2050 that illuminate the uncertainties, challenges, and opportunities presented by the coming confluence of two mega trends: an aging population and increasingly sensed people and environments. The results include four scenarios including descriptions and key features, and with narratives available in the appendix. In the discussion, we reflect on five provocations distilled from expert interviews to illustrate what aging might look like in 2050 from a variety of socio-economic vantage points and mediated by technological capabilities and arrangements born of differing policy, economic, and societal conditions.}

Predictions for a + 1.5 °C world indicate that 13.8% of the global population will be exposed to heat waves (HWs), a proportion rising to 36.9% in a + 2 °C scenario. At present, about 9.6 M people in the EU and UK are exposed to extreme heat every year. Overheating has various impacts on cities, including urban infrastructure failures and changes in ecological processes. However, scarce attention is currently paid to the distribution of HWs impacts and the differential vulnerabilities of different social groups, raising the issue of climate justice in cities. HWs directly impact the health of the most vulnerable social groups resulting in an increase in mortality and morbidity rates. This research focuses on the city of Padua (Italy) as a pilot study to assess the effects of urban HWs and heat islands (UHI) combined. By framing the unequal spatial distribution of socially vulnerable groups, this study aims to i) provide a replicable spatially explicit open-access methodology to assess the heat-related risk of UHI; ii) propose the first climate justice heat-related risk index to be adopted in inclusive and just adaptation plans. Specifically, it aims to i) identify HWs and map critical hotspots during summer 2022 at suburban scale; ii) assess the spatial correlations among impervious areas and UHI; iii) map the climate risk to vulnerable social groups; and iv) propose a global climate justice risk index for all the vulnerable groups considered. Images from Landsat 8–9 were processed, and territorial data were acquired from public databases. It was found that three extreme HWs hit Padua in summer 2022, on 2–7 June, 21–23 July, and 4–8 August, when maximum temperatures were 35.1 °C, 36.1 °C, and 35.8 °C, respectively. The intensity and magnitude of UHIs were considerable, with land surface temperatures of 33.8 °C on average (σ = 1.7, min = 27.9, max = 41.4). UHI intensity reached 5–8 °C of difference with rural contexts, mainly in strongly urbanized sectors. Ordinary least squares regression indicated a positive correlation with impervious surfaces, with a β coefficient showing an average increase of 0.3 °C per 10% of soil sealing. Six different hotspots were identified both in industrial areas and within the city centre. However, the integrated climate risk analyses highlight that most critical areas are in sectors where there is a large number of the elderly, migrants, children, and low-income households. Our findings reveal the need for urgent heat island mitigation measures and that the distributive dimension of climate justice should be respected in adaptation planning.}

Furthermore, utilizing external reference texts that characterize service robots from a technical perspective, we propose and apply a novel approach to match the constructed topics to service robotics. The matching procedure is based on frequency and exclusivity of words overlapping between the patents and the reference texts. We identify around 20 topics belonging to service robotics. Our results corroborate earlier findings, but also provide novel insights on the content and stage of development of application areas in service robotics. With this study we contribute to a better understanding of the highly dynamic field of robotics as well as to new practices of utilizing the topic modeling approach, matching the resulting topics to external classifications and applying to them metrics from graph theory.}

abstract = {Wildland fire is common and widespread in Alaskan tundra. Tundra fires exert considerable influence on local ecosystem functioning and contribute to climate change through biogeochemical (e.g. carbon cycle) and biogeophysical (e.g. albedo) effects. These treeless landscapes are characterized by a high degree of variation in fuel loading at scales much finer than moderate (30 m) satellite observations. However, because of the remoteness of the tundra and its lower contribution to carbon release compared to boreal forests, most frequently tundra fuels are poorly characterized, limiting the effective development of tundra-specific fire occurrence and behavior models. This study presents an approach to mapping the fractional coverages of major fuel type components in Alaskan tundra circa 2015 combining field data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager observations. We adopt a multi-step Random Forest method to estimate the fractional vegetation cover of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel level. We demonstrate the strong capability of exploiting multi-seasonal spectral information to identify these component types, with R-squared values around 0.95 and root mean squared errors below 10% for predicting their fractional cover. Our mapping products depict the spatial distribution of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel resolution across Alaskan tundra, which can function as a critical input for studying wildland fire risk and behavior in the tundra. The distributions of these fuel components align well with climate-based tundra ecoregions although climate variables are not included in our models.}

In order to minimize damage from fires to the forest vegetation, information on frequency, timing and control of fire events is needed for decision making at the district and regional management levels of the Forestry Commission. However, not much of such information exists, particularly for northern Ghana. Therefore, this research sought to ascertain occurrences of forest fires and how they are controlled in three (3) Forest Districts in the northern region of Ghana namely: the Tamale, Yendi and Walewale Forest Districts. Respondents comprised staff of Ghana Forestry commission, members of fringe communities and personnel from the Ghana National Fire Service. A mixed method research design involving structured interview schedule, in-depth interviews and quantitative review of secondary data was employed for data collection. Quantitative data was analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages while qualitative data was analyzed using simple narratives. The study revealed that detection by smoke was the dominant means of detecting fires within the forest reserves. December and January were the months with the most fire occurrences and periods between 2 and 4 h and greater than 8 h were the dominant timeframes within which fires were controlled. Inadequate firefighting equipment and lack of effective cooperation between regulatory institutions and community members were identified as major constraints to effective control of forest fires. Active collaboration between regulatory agencies and members of fringe communities among others are recommended for effective control of wildfires in forest reserves in northern region of Ghana.}

The results showed that from 1975 to 2000, the area of mangrove forests declined sharply (by nearly 2,000 ha), mainly due to policies of development and conversion of land use. From 2000 to 2022, the mangrove forest area was gradually restored, while the area under aquaculture shrank. Anthropogenic impacts, especially the effects of local economic development, and conservation and developmental policies, are the main causes of continuous change in each short period.

Our findings can serve as a basis for planning, conservation strategies, and sustainable development of wetland ecosystems and for improving the associated livelihoods of the communities.}

Cost-effective monitoring is challenging because of the long design life for surface barriers, spatial limitations and finite lifetime of in situ sensors, and performance metrics related to drainage. Hence, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic induction (EMI) tools were evaluated for use in performance monitoring of surface barriers. GPR and EMI were used to non-invasively interrogate the Prototype Hanford Barrier (PHB), an evapotranspiration-capillary break barrier established in 1994 at the Hanford Site, in southeastern Washington State. Both geophysical methods were evaluated for providing indirect estimates of subsurface moisture content conditions that were compared to point scale measurements from borehole neutron logs. Surveys were performed during characteristically wet and dry periods to observe a range of hydrologic states of the barrier soil. Although EMI surveys were expected to show seasonal changes associated with changes in the bulk conductivity of the barrier soil layers, the effectiveness of the method was limited by the effects of metallic infrastructure embedded in the barrier. GPR estimates of volumetric water content were typically within 2–3% of the highest water contents from neutron probe measurements for both wet and dry periods, providing reasonable estimates of water content. Given that PHB monitoring data over the past 25 years has demonstrated its success in limiting deep drainage, GPR was found to be a cost-effective method for demonstrating continued barrier performance, with a greater capacity to quantify moisture content distributions over much larger areas relative to point measurements.}

Other than the severity of the attack and the behaviour of the bushfires, the architectural design of the houses, construction materials and, many other factors affect bushfire house ignition. These are generally ignored in the simulations using simplified models. An improved bushfire risk assessment can be conducted if the exact surrounding and the architectural design of the existing houses are considered. However, this is not widely practised due to associated high cost and time, which can be minimised by the adaptation of modern technologies in an efficient way. This study proposes a novel approach to assess the effect of bushfires on individual building structures (houses) in bushfire-prone areas, through heat transfer modelling. It utilises ground and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud to model individual building structures with all their complex features and the surroundings with good dimensional accuracy. These point cloud maps were used to develop heat transfer models by using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) to investigate wind velocities, temperature profiles and pressure distributions during bushfires. A case study was conducted for a selected house (elevated building structure) using the proposed approach and the results were compared against a simplified cuboid model of the same house. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is capable of identifying the most vulnerable locations of the building structure compared to the simplified model, which emphasises its applicability in bushfire planning and damage mitigation.}
